Something that a girl like me never dreamed of
It never was for me, (no not really)
But there was not a guy who was special enough
Until you came and made me so happy
Like a child on Christmas Day
I was so, so, so, so anticipating
And I didn't know I could ever feel this way

Love saw it
Love saw the change in my heart
You brought me so much joy
Love saw it
Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy
You bring me joy, you bring me joy, you bring me joy

I used to think that love was a mischief
Something that a guy just could not figure out
As if I never had no fancy stuff
Not even a clue what true love was about
Until you came and made life worth living
Like the very first day of spring
I was so, so anticipating
Girl, I didn't know I had love inside of me

Love saw it
Love saw the change in my heart
You brought me so much joy
Love saw it
Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy

Oh girl, my, my girl
I never thought that I could love a girl the way I do
Oh boy, my my my my boy
I'm so glad that I found your love too

Love saw it
Love saw the change in my heart
You brought me so much joy
Love saw it
Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy (x2)

You bring me joy, me joy, me joy, me joy, me joy
You bring me joy, me joy, me joy, me joy, me joy
Keep on bringin me
Keep on bringin me‰Û_joy

Love called my name, love saw me change
Love rescued me from the danger of pain
Love called my name, love saw me change
Love rescued me from the danger of pain
Love called my name, love made me change
Love rescued me from the danger of pain
Love called my name, love saw me change
Love rescued me from the danger, danger of pain

You brought me so much joy
Love saw it, love saw it
Love saw the hopes of a girl and a boy

I just can't explain it
My heart can't contain it
Love saw the change in my heart
You brought me so much joy

Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed, at least I lived as I believed.
No matter what they take from me they can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me

The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve learning to love yourself,
it is the greatest love of all

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they posses inside
Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I live as I believed
No matter what they take from me

I found the greatest love of all inside of me

Learning to love yourself,

Leads you to a lonely place

On the front lobe of
My left side brain

Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided
Who's one of my kind.

A single thing you do

Just in time
I'm so glad
You have a one track
Mind like me.

You gave my life direction
A game show love connection
We can't deny

I'm so obsessed
My heart is bound to beat
Right out my untrimmed chest

I believe in you.

You're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna

Watching you're the only drug I need

I can be myself now finally
In fact there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be
With me
