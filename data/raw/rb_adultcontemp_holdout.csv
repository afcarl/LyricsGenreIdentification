Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Calvary choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word

A million smiling faces
Life Is so incredible to me
Especially to be near you
And how it is to touch you
Oh, paradise was made for you and me
Sometimes I feel like a sad song

I know that life goes on just perfectly
Everything is just the way that it should be
Still there are times when my heart feel like breaking
And anywhere is where I'd rather be

Oh, and in the nighttime
I know that it's the right time

To have someone to share with
And someone I can care with

From the 1969 film ""The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie"" starring Oscar-winner
Maggie Smith
Written by Rod McKuen
Peak chart position # 2 in 1969


Jean, Jean, roses are red
All the leaves have gone green
And the clouds are so low
You can touch them, and so
Come out to the meadow, Jean

Jean, Jean, you're young and alive
Come out of your half-dreamed dream
And run, if you will, to the top of the hill
Open your arms, bonnie Jean

Till the sheep in the valley come home my way
Till the stars fall around me and find me alone
When the sun comes a-singin' I'll still be waitin'

For Jean, Jean, roses are red
And all of the leaves have gone green
While the hills are ablaze with the moon's yellow haze
Come into my arms, bonnie Jean

(Jean, Jean)
Jean, you're young and alive!
Come out of your half-dreamed dream
And run, if you will to the top of the hill
Come into my arms, bonnie Jean

Freedom's light burning warm
Freedom's light burning warm

Everywhere around the world
They're coming to America
Every time that flag's unfurled
They're coming to America

Got a dream to take them there
They're coming to America
Got a dream they've come to share
They're coming to America

They're coming to America
They're coming to America
They're coming to America

My country 'tis of thee

Sweet land of liberty

Of thee I sing

Sunny sat down in the kitchen
She opened a book and a box of tools
Sunny came home with a mission

She says days go by, I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire

Sunny came home with a list of names
She didn't believe in transcendence
And it's time for a few small repairs, she said
Sunny came home with a vengeance

She says days go by, I don't know why
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire

Get the kids and bring a sweater
Dry is good and wind is better
Count the years, you always knew it
Strike a match, go on and do it

Oh, days go by, I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire

Oh, light the sky and hold on tight
The world is burning down
She's out there on her own, and she's all right

On the rock and roll radio
And when a young girl doesn't have any friends
That's a really nice place to go
Folks hoping you'd turn out cool
But they had to take you out of school
You're a little touched, you know
Angie baby

Lovers appear in your room each night
And they whirl you across the floor
But they always seem to fade away
When your daddy taps on your door
Angie girl, are you alright?
Tell the radio goodnight
All alone once more
Angie baby

Angie baby
You're a special lady
Living in a world of make believe
Well, maybe

Stopping at her house is a neighbor boy
With evil on his mind
'Cause he's been peeking in Angie's room
At the night through her window blind
I see your folks have gone away
Would you dance with me today
I'll show you how to have a good time
Angie baby (Angie baby, Angie baby)

When he walks in her room
He feels confused
Like he walked into a play
And the music's so loud
It spins him around
'Til his soul has lost its way
And as she turns the volume down
He's getting smaller with the sound
It seems to pull him off the ground
Toward the radio he's bound
Never to be found

The headlines read that a boy disappeared
And everyone thinks he died
'Cept a crazy girl with a secret lover
Who keeps her satisfied
It's so nice to be insane
No one asks you to explain
Radio by your side
Angie baby

Angie baby
You're a special lady
Living in a world of make believe
Well, maybe
Well, maybe (Angie baby, Angie baby)

I've been passing time watching trains go by
All of my life
Lying on the sand watching sea birds fly
Wishing there would be
Someone waiting home for me
Something's telling me it might be you
It's telling me it might be you
All of my life

Looking back as lovers go walking past
All of my life
Wondering how they met and what makes it last
If I found the place
Would I recognize the face
Something's telling me it might be you
Yeah, it's telling me it might be you

So many quiet walks to take
So many dreams to make
And with so much love to make
I think we're gonna meet some time
Maybe all we need is time...
And it's telling me it might be you
All of my life

I've been saving love songs and lullabies
And there's so much more
No one's ever heard before
Something's telling me it might be you
Yeah, it's telling me it must be you
And I'm feeling it'll just be you all of my life

Have you ever loved, loved, loved

You keep running, running away
I know you can't run forever
You think you're heading for a heartbreak again
Just as you did before

I can teach you how to love again
If you just trust in me
I can show you things you never seen
You don't know how...

CHORUS
Have you ever loved somebody
Can you learn to love somebody
When somebody loves you
Have you ever known that feeling
Ooh that special feeling
When somebody loves you

You build a fortress around yourself
Your emotions they hide within
You've got your heart securely locked away
And you won't let nobody in

I can teach you how to love again
If you just trust in me
I can show you things you never seen
You don't know how...

CHORUS
Have you ever loved somebody
Can you learn to love somebody
When somebody loves you (can you tell me please)
Have you ever known that feeling
Ooh that special feeling (don't it feel good)
When somebody loves you

Oh, When you think that it's safe, girl
Just take a look around
I will be there behind you
There's nothing to fear, no
'Cuz I can never hurt you
I think the world about you
Can you learn to love me, too
Can you learn to love me, too

Mmm, I can teach you how to love again (love again)
If you just trust in me
I can show you things you never seen
You don't know how...

When life leaves you high and dry
I'll be at your door tonight
If you need help, if you need help
I'll shut down the city lights,
I'll lie, cheat, I'll beg and bribe
To make you well, to make you well
When enemies are at your door
I'll carry you way from more
If you need help, if you need help
Your hope dangling by a string
I'll share in your suffering
To make you well, to make you well

Give me reasons to believe,
That you would do the same for me

And I would do it for you, for you
Baby I'm not moving on
I love you long after you're gone
For you, for you
You would never sleep alone
I love you long after you're gone
And long after you're
Gone, gone, gone

When you fall like a statue
I'm gon' be there to catch you
Put you on your feet, you on your feet
And if your well is empty
Not a thing will prevent me
Tell me what you need,
What do you need

I surrender honestly
You've always done the same for me

So I would do it for you, for you
Baby I'm not moving on
I love you long after you're gone
For you, for you
You would never sleep alone
I love you long after you're gone
And long after you're
Gone, gone, gone

You're my back bone,
You're my cornerstone
You're my crutch when my legs stop moving
You're my headstart,
You're my rugged heart
You're the pokes that I've always needed
Like a drum baby don't stop beating
Like a drum baby don't stop beating
Like a drum baby don't stop beating
Like a drum my heart never stops beating

For you, for you
Baby I'm not moving on
I love you long after you're gone
For you, for you
You would never sleep alone
I love you long after you're gone
For you, for you
Baby I'm not moving on
I love you long after you're gone
For you, for you
You would never sleep alone
I love you long, long after you're gone

Like a drum baby don't stop beating
Like a drum baby don't stop beating

You should understand me
Like I understand you
Now girl I know the difference
Between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothing
To break up our happy home
Don't get so excited
When I come home
A little late at night
Cos we only act like children
When we argue fuss and fight

If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me

We've all got our
Own funny moods
I've got mine,
Woman you've got yours too
Just trust in me like I trust in you
As long as we've been together
It should be so easy to do
Just get yourself together
Or we might as well say goodbye
What good is a love affair
When you can't see eye to eye

We've reached our climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to
Run away
Do we separate?
Don't wanna give in so we both gave up
Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax
Climax

I've fallen somehow
Feet off the ground
Love is the cloud
That keeps raining down
Where are you now?
When I need you around
I'm on my knees, but it seems we're

I gave my best, it wasn't enough
You get upset, we argue too much
We made our mess, what used to be love
So why do I care, I care at all
At all
At all
At all

We've reached our climax
We're together, now we're undone
Won't commit so we choose to

Can't take it back, it's too late, we've reached the climax

You say it's better if we
Love each other separately
I just need you one more time
I can't get what we had out my mind
Where are you now
When I need you around
I'm on my knees
But it seems we're going

Going nowhere fast

Blames the one before
And all of their frustrations
Come beating on your door

I know that I'm a prisoner
To all my Father held so dear
I know that I'm a hostage
To all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years

Crumpled bits of paper
Filled with imperfect thoughts
Stilted conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got

You say you just don't see it
He says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
In this present tense
We all talk a different language
Talkin' in defense

Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye

So we open up a quarrel
Between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future
It's the bitterness that lasts

So Don't yield to the fortunes
You sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
On a different date
And if you don't give up, and don't give in
You may just be O.K.

Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye

I wasn't there that morning
When my Father passed away
I didn't get to tell him
All the things I had to say

I think I caught his spirit
Later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo
In my baby's new born tears
I just wish I could have told him in the living years

Say it loud, say it clear
You can listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die
To admit we don't see eye to eye

Say it loud, say it clear
Say it loud
Don't give up
Don't give in",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.008795977,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/q5OsbtdylOsrM3hwBu0ZT6wZ4A+PLzGkeSBEyVLd66RpLIxZjF+k2m2qN2T2cd7QKiD1l9yxi8Vjw2kubyTBqloQpZub/rcZGxvFKQe6jQcp+mSPbv0Wy2qEXzVHNZo40I/YvE8chQwjoleFs+RA4HvyEQQbO8PGD8PBLTxOXWATz/lg9qHlZWeEI1hTd83jZZ/WVBw+obmZ0A2HK47W/Pwf8KyQTOFbZi2izcNRQIfT4GkzckQHlNUK+Bzr+GmNNdTAm0zkuBPXQpMtm87EeVE0Rltpphj4jd5bXIb2Bk0UFNBhjpVHU5HZu8bP61OJ6v2H42PYdBAl2tjb5oQlf2kqQm/PyPVkN7d17haZ1luJR3ILZJQiOggWiuALi1KPjK7XziOxm7v/eneTxJQNhmEMBFXFQh3kmZQuuVgudFI=/,8779474.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/VCXp0vFgfTd7AvAoCpYzk/deTdwPKyhqvkdrBFvaRINiXU9Eo44H0IS2olHuFf5QOkAq9pe7U2JEpYeJZ7CIbU5VEEQWo26vjXDc9o38o+oyBvY7sAdxqENTU9bqPN5u2onDOCy+dj240E1SLX6Eo5UJ/4a4leBmCMY4yWj+fUV5gISALcGGNGr2Ptqm7vQrWgnt6GZ528nyEkRees3o3V1o3U53eNcKeG/6VvME3PS+YUm2FGFRg7CD7b2ooNweII7K/O+hx2OEbYPJC3COA/Y3Sp2HFDgFyoBhWCqeRUKLtZLOlSSFMno0vBji3VVgurQnfPAtnJASjInxPz/py4K62GeXZeiQom0eLlNoHTPVJvq/PFZZ+PxIhUmDltsMWo4VOeInFEAadcE1FaHR8NLZvWJfmkcQZiNCDYUuclQ=/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 06:04:26 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/LI5tV7lv6TqDgOjxxNGLt+l+FICERp9h6Svw6L3OP2cKkD+ySazjN0GGSbjmiHkfQV74bvf3pEn/gHtbWZriWnogg2SGJb6NI6JbBQLFNiE+w+b2HYDvhsp0cNjdxzJM6yynt/QfgU8cHNcXbOcqBQOpQmdMuo4HKHgSHpM72P91Ik/FIYZEvZiVLpCONY9wzLXJ0NCBX8DLDoPFaKsHRJgocpLwjhtmKIZLIO6by/BgTsR450ay4MRWcneQ9eFCrhdhjJQVaVJqq2KamRX9NveezC1XfPFV+6BB7CikwiXmRI0qhAzTxpf1YqafT+8WN26HQs2/s9Bqii8y3n3Fzd4o+pLTBLayd7ultPWePT5HGA+tA01zAAIvoKTfYR6xyU1d64Vhu+RjMUZE5z8+pS3/l42HR9ZHTbhE7GvE4BA=/,200.0,2013-12-15T17:45:44Z,[],the living years,1989

The kind you make your wishes on
Like the light in your eyes
The one I built my dreams upon

It's not there any longer
Something happened somewhere
And we both know what
But meaning's getting stronger
We must stop pretending
I can't live this life

I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more
Too much talking
Let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more
This is time for letting go

I hear a whisper in the air
It simply doesn't bother me
Can't you see that I don't care
Or are you looking right through me

It seems to me lately
You look at me the wrong way
And I start to cry
Could it be that maybe
This crazy situation is the reason why

I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more
Too much talking
Let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more

Oh, baby don't you know
I don't wanna hurt no more
This time I'm walking, babe
Don't care now who's to blame
I don't really wanna fight no more

Hanging on to the past
It only stands in our way
We have to grow for our love to last
But we just grew apart
Don't wanna hurt no more

But, baby don't you know, know
I don't wanna hurt no more

For the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
If you said goodbye to me tonight
There would still be music left to write
What else could I do
I'm so inspired by you
That hasn't happened for the longest time

Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
That's where you found me
When you put your arms around me
I haven't been there for the longest time

Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
And the greatest miracle of all
Is how I need you
And how you needed me too
That hasn't happened for the longest time

Maybe this won't last very long
But you feel so right
And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far
And it's more than I hoped for

Who knows how much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time

I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself
Hold on to your heart
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far
And it's more than I hoped for

I don't care what consequence it brings
I have been a fool for lesser things
I want you so bad
I think you ought to know that
I intend to hold you for the longest time",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.00880599,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/FFUE5Gum3BNB9d0Ajyhtd8b2ZeQ4/oTm4CVlyrKEvEe4iSrH3RNv0Q4cX2Q4PZdHtSnewHKwjYmvV6Zoz7tNv40LYXjb70+4aQkEHYmA5bHw/1nXM2xeeUfmUQLu5ilpy5TP+dO+HtHg7FHCE5n3QIZnqbD/Sm2dl5gejfZiK9vlyZNoztQP9Xx9VgbEc8LlSZdif10ajL26JEFmlFZ1wLccdexSNNKEy6BmTNPweIvobX9xsnR971UBHO9IoQRINUoj5nu5riE18fYDuHTXtgzeXl1Mpw7a+slLYotzg/nhIGzxxU6l/nj8M6DEf6u4e/W1ivTVPPrKTjtq91opCjDS3RYxqBRC8QQmW0/FR5g39C+2Zozbn2ztIvpIHgTNgj/GNnGAN+DacbypEDX81HdhWOs2SSEdsgo9Fy/CoqY=/,1533812.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/vGu0CPuVWqv1AJ9PLgIqHDNd3c/e0d3ahN+B+iYtUvFrGXMt8r2SaHC6IOtPyvd3re9CPo1kbf7EWxzuN7DPFETIXgdw+7Ekj4HYJHVW4e2JCf5QGR1iNIPDIsuFW+i0anEiSOX1eNiS639P3aENlfLiQ+VsR+IwRb07ILbkcTal8IeNDmXzRBqzmpr0X8lc/C3kGbnbDAAziovsH69ftGM2B+3JP0neG31cGUVafz9JJX97se8LDHzWEeVV1HdRdvAKnHZ1LI3Z8oOPSZ2CzLrFkni/sK+upID2XMHzPvDzxc3DlPVkD+y04fSUobRhYkd92OB9XxpkvRFaZ3ZSEijvIT2gtYiShOfI1GBFOEflqNKUW/Zq/6RJG1oZBg87/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 06:02:29 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/7PN3pmxvXl6J2vawjIbwwa3cs2Or02HWAHPaPDjQZA5LxP4XH+9k1lXr5y566rbj95UyZo9UKzjF238gJ+UD0mI1d4Rf5BK3L23OHRQars/r5XiZzvooENGCtHYYm+Vbsvi097/6f2o2nXM2Ep+JWD6ZrtxNOlFgzo1ilNxYLihJ/a/8CuDUoCUFHmcFiCNwThivnw8Cqb5DV4u+1zDKZm4qzyxxkuSsS2TezH1UKQ9zaeN9qgWJ1fVFuNTFmLTgM0/K/Da7mY7ADeeq3+SxsoTR4ztaYZ4vehJ4aNTPkl0fn5ytV1W77enbPkRqFihNhoMQQi84cUI9M57pEOEVsa8whdpKwgBJFgwxU14v6qsroNHAR2QZSqCrSGB3v8nG/,200.0,2011-02-08T20:13:08Z,[],the longest time,1984

One, two, three and to the fo'
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the do'
Ready to make an entrance, so back on up
(cause you know we're bout to rip shit up)
Gimme the microphone first, so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble
Ain't nuttin but a G thang, baaaaabay!
Two loc'ed out niggaz so we're craaaaazay!
Death Row is the label that paaaaays me!
Unfadeable, so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah!)
But uhh, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected, so I'ma let em understand
from a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch I have to find a contraceptive
You never know she could be earnin her man
and learnin her man -- and at the same time burnin her man
Now you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it
(YEAH!) And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

[Dr. Dre and Snoop]
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
[S] Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom

[Dr. Dre]
Well I'm peepin, and I'm creepin, and I'm creep-in
But I damn near got caught, cause my beeper kept beepin
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seatbelt
You never been on a ride like this befo'
with a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know, and I know, I flow some ol funky shit
to add to my collection, the selection
symbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
on what me and my homey Snoop Dogg came to do

[Dr. Dre and Snoop]
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this
[D] And who gives a fuck about those?
[S] So just chill, til the next episode

{*funky sample break*}

[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Fallin back on that ass, with a hellafied gangsta lean
Gettin funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S, oh yes I'm fresh, N double-O P
D O double-G Y, D O double-G, ya see
Showin much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimpin hoes and clockin a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some motherfuckin G shit
(Hell yeah!) So Dre (Whattup Dogg?)
Gotta give em what they want (What's that, G?)
We gotta break em off somethin (Hell yeah!)
And it's gotta be bumpin (City of Compton!)

[Dr. Dre]
It's where it takes place so when asked, yo' attention
Mobbin like a muh'fucker, but I ain't lynchin
Droppin the funky shit that's makin the sucka niggaz mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, cause if I slip, then I'm slippin
But if I got my Nina, then you know I'm straight trippin
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on, to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, and the city they call Long Beach
Puttin the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C., ""No One Can Do it Better""

[Dr. Dre and Snoop]
Like this, that and this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this
[D] And who gives a fuck about those?

All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me

(R. Kelly)
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

(Puffy)
When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, opposites attract but
We one and the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play witchu, I wanna lay witchu,
Stay witchu, pray witchu, grow old and gray witchu,
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
'Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
'Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier

(R. Kelly)
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

(Puffy)
Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any bagguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
'Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true

(R. Kelly)
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

(R. Kelly II)
Don't let him sing you a sad song (No baby)
Waiting for love like this too long
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby)
All that you need I can give you
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on)
I do, satisfy you
(You don't have to wait on him)

(Puffy)
I'm that light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare In the moment of despair,
I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you

(R. Kelly)
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
'Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute, seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey, Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

There was something in the air that night

And he didn't leave much to ma and me,
Just this ole guitar and an empty bottle of booze.

Now I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid,
But the meanest thing that he ever did,
Was before he left he went and named me Sue.

Well, he musta thought that it was quite a joke,
An' it got a lot of laughs from lots a folks,
Seems I had to fight my whole life through.

Some gal would giggle and I'd get red,
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head,
I'll tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue.

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean,
My fist got hard and my wits got keen,
I roamed from town to town to hide my shame.

But I made me a vow to the moon and stars,
I'd search the honky-tonks and bars,
And kill that man that gave me that awful name.

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July,
And I'd just hit town and my throat was dry,
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew.

In an old saloon on a street of mud,
There at a table dealin' stud,
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me Sue.

Well I knew that snake was my own sweet dad,
From a worn out picture that my mother had,
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye.

He was big and bent and grey and old,
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold, and I said,
""My name is Sue! How do you do? Now you gonna die!""
Yeah! That's what I told him.

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes,
And he went down but to my surprise,
Came up with a knife an' cut off a piece o' my ear.

I busted a chair right across his teeth,
And we crashed through the wall and into the street,
Kickin' and a gougin' in the mud and the blood and the beer.

I tell ya, I've fought tougher men,
But I really can't remember when,
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile.

Well, I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss,
He went for his gun but I pulled mine first,
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile.

And he said, ""Son, this world is rough,
And if a man's gonna make it he's gotta be tough,
And I know I wouldn't be there to help you along.

So I gave you that name and I said goodbye,
I knew you'd have to get tough or die,
And it's that name that helped to make you strong.""

Yeah! He said, ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight,
And I know you hate me and ya got the right,
To kill me now and I wouldn't blame you if you do.

But you oughta thank me before I die,
For the gravel in your gut and the spit in the eye,
'Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue.""
Yeah, what could I do? What COULD I do?

I got all choked up and threw down my gun,
Called him my pa and he called me his son,
And I came away with a different point of view.

And I think about him now and then,
Every time I try and every time I win,
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him,
Bill or George, anything but Sue! I still hate that name!",Lyrics powered by www.musiXmatch.com,0.010789871000000001,0.0,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/HmlmMn4OYdtQNafueqpg+W+k2/YHDvofvQmmU2UCUbo0M61S5+hfiY08UTNqm4r6C9lxBJlErCOYdQp3BKRZVvM0H+wLHM37AQAAZ8n0wmAle6EeQ8LZAcDI3hjzZb64g636SEBPv38oSnOt5YN/pGHDoiiuE3zBuFM6vbVcbHYRzlscNrE5rO6V8EykCOCKMAy9xTS0IOUsV4rfXtK1CCvJ3ZgRR8UXy4dieGokNNWK+PceEBng47PrAHLwOjRXLEObhufpyqe80R7pWOK/dXq/yAesLvbRlDA4TXxl2ExHzfKYJdX0c/PD9rqt6+Nec+K+5KQx3rf+PfcgEC8xA+LHVcxeEtB2sV8TBTZb5r9gRH6IwqlgSi+MEoSXjC7hd55tPey7PgVUVL2iN/ovtiAt6uKMVqtIsSgqsZAuM5g=/,1538196.0,0.0,en,English,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/ddoVs/l8R/cmI6ROfq+5E7TqI/7MIgFSQoIuEV6gExCj3YVJU3vgG10xEs46bPpUdd83kHsxVxASVxzypoLCApwh294eTkdHJA7TC9Xtd70afmJEcnbprDw5R2r2n2EOBmqtikm7qEcYM/1b8JJqqU6v3eX6jZQJyoGu4wgYBx38nWcwyUOSA9887KhjLcm5sAa40rLIcd2V/n+Y+JVj1clupG4m5frNLtBueu0JgsfHVCevvZHIgrA/8ZqA1bLZ3oJ5ImIHSnD+eXYEd0d1d2SU3CZI7pXqefxWx9zX3+YRx7hJetEcMpLWDQSRMS3KJb8Z+8bqulq3VgRJqePSb+7lolQ+CF20/xw3uOqlAXrCI8aK4bS5S30l4mPnMPOVPQg8Mb+nMeNKdcKz2QFOWIUegWhdjXFvd6UlpV0PZH8=/,[],0.0,Thu Sep 25 05:56:11 2014,http://tracking.musixmatch.com/t1.0/YmMiv6tfTRqJMxLoZ35lsnIPi6heN16wa27pG6VI5n2H6WFwLgN7W/ChLhR1DvPaawa401igd2v2N9dAg1//rSBbigulEMqcDAwkY0wc0nWKwP8akYAD13WxbwcDDyR9JPCAb7aqZtvz7PdAA1nRGvP/944oDqAzsfrdkMjP69wTgURhUUHlmJhMv+c3Vol3xGwogsEXu8mUUDzb9atV5Wx0LDkoPghVfNb+46zpjalcCcyNR4zcnpcoj9O0taGpssBbgwUhdxmHA8LCg9sEQ0F6sYBoQaERSlFPRmqG3Zp6ZE9032GZVBiZAWoZdKdwF2gw01m5w/wthQupzyR/GND3hqNwjfoheueqPLN4PzGKfN6ZJ8G1IzoTlcCYbW5vr8ncmV/WIhWerSSL9VHi3i2m8xHeYt/2um0y70cG+OA=/,200.0,2010-07-06T22:24:33Z,[],a boy named sue,1969

Lovin' you or needin' you
So leavin' you now
You still won't know how to feel the pain

I was lookin' out for my happiness
While you were looking within
And before you know your own reflection
Always starts to tire you and it's happened again

There's really nothing more to say
I'll get along without your kiss goodnight
Just close the door and walk away

Never gonna fall in love again
I don't want to start with someone new
'Cause I couldn't bear to see it end
Just like me and you

No, I never want to feel the pain
Of remembering how it used to be
Never gonna fall in love again
Just like you and me

At first we thought that love was here to stay
The summer made it seem so right
But like the sun we watched it fade away
From morning into lonely night

Never gonna fall in love again
I don't want to start with someone new
'Cause I couldn't bear to see it end
Just like me and you

No, I never want to feel the pain
Of remembering how it used to be
Never gonna fall in love again
Just like you and me

Never gonna fall in love again
I don't want to start with someone new
'Cause I couldn't bear to see it end
Just like me and you

No, I never want to feel the pain

A shoulder there for me to cry on
And the hours alone that I'm without you
All I ever do is think about you

No one knows that you're so understanding
Even though my love is so demanding
Every time you look at me
Then you'll know we'll both agree
That no other love for me

I couldn't live without your love
Now I know you're really mine
Gotta have you all the time

Didn't like you much when I first met you
But somehow I couldn't quite forget you
Said you didn't want a friend or lover
That your life was happy with another

But as time went by my love grew stronger
Knew that I just couldn't wait any longer
For I couldn't let you go and I had to tell you so
That I love you, then you know

I couldn't live without your love
Now I know you really mine
Gotta have you all the time

Now the tears are gone and I'm not crying
When you say you love me you're not lying
So when people want to stare
I know I don't really care
Just as long as you are there

I couldn't live without your love
Now I know you really mine
I gotta have you all the time

Now I couldn't live without your love
Now I know you really mine
I gotta have you all the time

And every time you whisper my name, I wanna run to you
We'll be together, it won't be long, it won't be long
But it feels like forever and it's hard to be strong

CHORUS:

Baby, 'cause I'm missing you now
And it's drivin' me crazy
How I'm needin' you, baby
I'm missing you now
Can't wait till I'm alone with you
To show you how I'm missing you now

Wishin' you were here by my side is all that I can do
Got my arms around my pillow at night,
They should be holdin' you
Thought I was stronger, how could I know, how could I know
I can't take this much longer, it's so hard on my soul

Baby, 'cause I'm missing you now
And it's drivin' me crazy
I've gotta be with you, baby

Don't know what I'm gonna do
To show the way I'm missing you now

Baby, I just can't wait, till I see your face
Chase away this loneliness inside
When you're close to my heart, right here in my arms
Then and only then will I be satisfied
Missing you now

I know, we'll be together, it won't be long, it won't be long
But it feels like forever and it's hard to be strong

Baby, I should be holdin' you, kissin' you
I'm missing you
