194,miranda lambert,over you,Country,"Weatherman said it's gonna snow
By now I should be used to the cold
Mid-Februray shouldn't be so scary
It was only December, I still remember
The presents, the trees, you and me

But you went away
How dare you
I miss you
They say I'll be ok
But I'm not going to ever get over you

Living alone here in this place
I think of you and I'm not afraid
Your favorite records make me feel better
Cause you sing along with every song
I know you didn't mean to give them to me

But you went away
How dare you
I miss you
They say I'll be ok
But I'm not going to ever get over you

It really sinks in, you know, when I see it in stone

Cause you went away
How dare you
I miss you
They say I'll be ok
But I'm not going to ever get over you"
176,eli young band,crazy girl,Country,"Baby why you wanna cry?
You really oughta know that I
Just have to walk away sometimes
We're gonna do what lovers do
We're gonna have a fight or two
But I ain't ever changin' my mind

Crazy girl, don't you know that I love you?
And I wouldn't dream of goin' nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately?
I love you like crazy, girl

Wouldn't last a single day
I'd probably just fade away
Without you, I'd lose my mind
Before you ever came along
I was livin' life all wrong
Smartest thing I ever did was make you all mine

Crazy girl, don't you know that I love you?
And I wouldn't dream of goin' nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately?
I love you like crazy, girl

Crazy girl

Crazy girl, don't you know that I love you?
And I wouldn't dream of goin' nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately, 
I love you like

Crazy, girl, don't you know that I love you?
And I wouldn't dream of goin' nowhere
Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately?
I love you like crazy, girl

Like crazy
Crazy girl
Like crazy
Crazy girl
Like crazy"
101,jason aldean,she's country,Country,"You boys ever met a real country girl?
Talkin, true blue, out in the woods, down home, country girl

She's a hot little number in her pick-up truck
Daddy's sweet money done jacked it up
She's a party-all-nighter from South Carolina, a bad mamajama from down in Alabama
She's a raging Cajun, a lunatic from Brunswick, juicy Georgia peach
With a thick southern drawl, s*** swing and walk, brother she's all

Country, (shoot) from her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country, from the songs she plays to the prayers she prays,
That's the way she was born and raised, she ain't afraid to stay, country
Brother she's country

A hell raisin sugar when the sun goes down, mama taught her how to rip up a town
Honey dripping honey from the hollerin Kentucky, getcha flippin kinda trippie like a Mississippi hippie,
She's a Kansas princess, crazy mother trucker, undercover lover
Thick southern drawl, s*** swing and walk,
Brother she's all

Country (shoot) from her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country, from the songs she plays to the prayers she prays,
That's the way she was born and raised, she ain't afraid to stay, country
Nothin but country

(Thick southern drawl)
(s*** swing and walk)
(Aw show 'em how a country girl does it one time now)

Brother she's country, from her cowboy boots to her down home roots
Nothin but country
Yea yeayeaaa
She's country (shoot) from her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country, from the songs she plays to the prayers she prays,
That's the way she was born and raised she ain't afraid to stay, country
Yea she's nothing but country

She's all about the country
From the backwoods she's a homegrown, down to the bone, she's country"
64,carrie underwood,all-american girl,Country,"Since the day they got married
He'd been praying for a little baby boy
Someone he could take fishing
Throw the football and be his pride and joy

He could already see him holding that trophy
Taking his team to state
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket
All those big dreams changed

And now, he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet, little, beautiful, wonderful, perfect
All-American girl

Sixteen short years later
She was falling for the senior football star
Before you knew it he was dropping passes
Skipping practice just to spend more time with her

The coach said, 'Hey son, what's your problem?
Tell me have you lost your mind'
Daddy said 'You'll lose your free ride to college,
Boy, you better tell her goodbye'

But now, he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet, little, beautiful, wonderful, perfect
All-American

And when they got married and decided to have one of their own
She said, 'Be honest, tell me what you want'
And he said, 'Honey you ought to know'

A sweet, little, beautiful, one just like you
Oh, a beautiful, wonderful, perfect
All-American

Now, he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet, little, beautiful, wonderful, perfect
All-American girl

All-American girl"
120,jason aldean,the truth,Country,"Tell em all I'm on vacation,
Say I went to visit friends,
That you ain't heard or seen from me in quite a while,
When they ask you where I've been,
Tell em I'm out on the west coast where it don't ever rain,
And that I'm probably doing fine,

Just don't tell em I've gone crazy,
That I'm still strung out over you,
Tell em anything you want to,
Just don't tell em all the truth,
Yeah don't tell em all the truth,

Tell em all I'm out in Vegas,
Blowin' every dollar I ever made,
Tell em that I must be into something bad for me cause,
I sure lost a lot of weight,
Tell em I'm out on the road with some old rock and roll band,
Living like a gypsy can,

The truth is that I'm asking you to lie,
And we both know that it ain't right,
But if you ever loved me please,
Have some mercy on me,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

Tell em anything you want to,
Just don't tell em all the truth,
Yeah don't tell em all the truth,
I still need you,
Yeah that's the truth,
I still love you,
Baby that's the truth."
97,darius rucker,it won't be like this for long,Country,"He didn't have to wake up
He'd been up all night
Lying there in bed and listening
To his newborn baby cry
He makes a pot of coffee
He splashes water on his face
His wife gives him a kiss and says,
""It's gonna be okay""

""It won't be like this for long
One day we'll look back laughing
At the week we brought her home
This phase is gonna fly by
So baby, just hold on
It won't be like this for long""

Four years later, 'bout 4: 30
She's crawling in their bed
And when he drops her off at pre-school
She's clinging to his leg
The teacher peels her off of him
He says, ""What can I do?""
She says, ""Now, don't you worry
This'll only last a week or two""

""It won't be like this for long
One day soon you'll drop her off
And she won't even know you're gone
This phase is gonna fly by
If you can just hold on
It won't be like this for long""

Someday soon she'll be a teenager
And at times, he'll think she hates him
And he'll walk her down the aisle
And raise her veil,
But right now she's up and cryin'
And the truth is that he don't mind
As he kisses her goodnight
And she says her prayers

He lays down there beside her
Till her eyes are finally closed
And just watching her it breaks his heart
'Cause he already knows

It won't be like this for long
One day soon that little girl is gonna be
All grown up and gone
And this phase is gonna fly by
So he's trying to hold on
It won't be like this for long
It won't be like this for long"
182,eric church,drink in my hand,Country,"Early Monday morning 'til Friday at five,
Man I work work work but I don't climb climb climb.
Boss man can shove that overtime up his can,
All I wanna do is put a drink in my hand.

Ya fill it up; I'll throw it down,
I got a forty hour week worth of trouble to drown.
No need to complicate it; I'm a simple man,
All you gotta do is put a drink in my hand.

Yeah the parking lot is muddy; can't get to the door,
I'll take my jacked up drop 'er down in four-by-four.
Chill down a long neck, warm up the band,
All you gotta do is put a drink in my hand.

Ya fill it up; I'll throw it down,
I'm about to tear a new one in this old town.
5 4 3 2 1 - I'm a rocket man,
All you gotta do is put a drink in my hand.

Make me wanna go ooh ooh ooh when you dance like that,
You got that little tattoo playing peeky boo on your back.
Yeah if you wanna impress me baby here's my plan,
All you gotta do is put a drink in my hand.

Yeah fill it up; I'll throw it down,
When you drive me home; take the long way around.
You'll be my Lois Lane - I'll be your Super Man,
All you gotta do is put a drink in my hand.

My head Monday morning as that alarm clock sings,
It goes bang bang bang while it ring ring rings.
Yeah I'm ready to roll if you want to rock again,
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand.

Yeah fill it up; I'll throw it down,
I got a little hungover still hanging around.
Yea that hair of a dog is howling hey there man,
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand.

Yea that hair of a dog is howling hey there man,
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand.

Haaaouuhhh Yeaaa"
73,blake shelton,home,Country,"Fires are burning up the forests
Down along the Amazon
There's children starving in Guatemala
They're just barely hanging on

And I pray they'll find the answer
That there's a way to right the wrong
And Lord while you're listening
Could I mention some troubles of my own
I got problems right here at home

A teenage boy in Mississippi
Brings his daddy's gun to school
A little girl in New York City
Buys cocaine for Mama to use

And I pray they'll find the answer
That there's a way to right the wrong
And Lord while you're listening
Could I mention some troubles of my own
I got problems right here at home

My wife is crying; Our baby's fighting
A battle that she may not win
The doctor's doing all that he can
God now it's all in your hands

And I pray they'll find the answer
That there's a way to right the wrong

Now I'm just one man, a grain of sand
In a troubled world I know
But I've got a problem right here at home
I've got a problem right here at home"
112,toby keith,american ride,Country,"Winters getting colder, Summer gettin' warmer
Tidal wave comin' cross the Mexican border
Why buy a gallon it's cheaper by the barrel
Just don't get busted singing Christmas carols

[[Chorus]]
That's us, that's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the o-zone burnin'
Funny how the world keeps turnin'
Look Ma, no hands
I love this American Ride
Gotta love this American Ride

Mama gets her rocks off watchin' desperate housewives
Daddy works his can off payin' for the good life
Kids on the you tube learnin' how to be cool
Livin' in a cruel world, pays to be a mean girl

[[Chorus]]
That's us, that's right
Gotta love this American ride
Both ends of the o-zone burnin'
Funny how the world keeps turnin'
Look Ma, no hands
I love this American Ride
Gotta love this American Ride

Poor little infamous, America's town.
She gained five pounds and lost her crown.
Quick fix plastic surgical antidote.
Got herself a record deal, can't even sing a note

Plasma gettin' bigger, Jesus gettin smaller.
Spill a cup of coffee, make a million dollars.
Customs caught a thug with an aerosol can.
If the shoe don't fit, the fits gonna hit the shan.

[[Chorus]]
That's us, that's right
Gotta love this American ride.
Both ends of the ozone burnin.
Funny how the world keeps turnin.
Hot dog, Hot damn.
I love this American ride.
Gotta love this American ride.

Oh yeah,
Na na na na na na na na..."
136,blake shelton,all about tonight,Country,"Don't bother telling me what I got coming in the morning
I already know
I got some feelgood pills and a red gatorade by my bed
Ready to go

I'm gonna do my best to dance with every girl in this bar
Before they shut it down
Then I'll pay my tab climb in a cab
Headin' to a spot downtown

It's all about tonight
Good times and the music and laughing and grooving to the band
Everybody's getting right
No worries we're rocking all kinds of concoctions in our hands
Yeah tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
It's all about tonight

Hey pretty thing
I've been looking at you since the moment that you walked in
I got some some wildest buddies that love spending money
And I see you brought a couple of friends

Just tell me your name
I don't need your number or a date next saturday
Baby let's act like fools break a few rules
Party the night away

It's all about tonight
Good times and the music and laughing and grooving to the band
Everybody's getting right
No worries we're rocking all kinds of concoctions in our hands
Yeah tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
It's all about tonight

Haha slide

It's all about tonight
Good times and the music and laughing and grooving to the band
Everybody's getting right

Yeah tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
I said tomorrow can wait 'til tomorrow
It's all about tonight

Yeah it's all about tonight
Come on it's all about tonight
We're gonna get our swerve on a buzz on
