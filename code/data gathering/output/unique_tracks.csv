0,alicia keys,like you'll never see me again,R_and_B,"If I had no more time
No more time left to be here
Would you cherish what we had?
Was it everything that you were looking for?
If I couldn't feel your touch
And no longer were you with me
I'd be wishing you were here
To be everything that I'd be looking for
I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted the time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day is not really guaranteed

So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again

Oh Oh Ohhhhh

How many really know what love is?
Millions never will
Do you know until you lose it
That it's everything that we are looking for
When I wake up in the morning
You're beside me
I'm so thankful that I found
Everything that I been looking for

I don't wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don't wanna take for granted the time you may have here with me
'Cause Lord only knows another day is not really guaranteed

So everytime you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
(can you do that for me baby)
Every time you touch me
(see we don't really know)
Touch me like this is the last time
(see everyday we never know)
Promise that you'll love me
(I want you to promise me)
Love me like you'll never see me again
(like you'll never see me again)

1,keyshia cole,i remember,R_and_B,"Ohhh....
Remember...
Ohhh, I remember...
I wanna know...

[Verse 1:]
Where were you when I said I loved you?
And where were you when I cried at night?
Waiting up, couldn't sleep without you.
Thinking of all the times we shared.

[Chorus:]
I remember when my heart broke.
I remember when I gave up loving you.
My heart couldn't take no more of you.
I was sad and lonely.
I remember when I walked out.
I remember when I screamed I hated you.
But somehow deep inside I'm still loving you.
I'm sad and lonely.

[Verse 2:]
No one knew all the pain I went through.
All the love I saved deep in my heart for you.
Didn't know where I would go, where I would be.
But you made me leave.
And plus my heart it just, it kept telling me so.

[Chorus:]
I remember when my heart broke.
I remember when I gave up loving you.
My heart couldn't take no more of you.
I was sad and lonely.
I remember when I walked out.
I remember when I screamed I hated you.
But somehow deep inside I'm still loving you.
So sad and lonely.

[Bridge:]
There was nowhere else to go, oh.
Nobody else to turn to, no.
For the rest of my life, I promised myself I will love me first genuinely.

[Chorus:]
I remember when my heart broke.
I remember when I gave up loving you.
My heart couldn't take no more of you.
I was sad and lonely.
I remember when I walked out.
I remember when I said I hated you.
But somehow deep inside I'm still loving you.
Sad and lonely.

I remember when I walked out.
I remember when I gave up loving you.
My heart couldn't take no more of you.
So sad and lonely, hey.
I remember when I stormed out.
I remember when I gave up loving you.
I was sad and lonely."

Sent from heaven.

Now you can wait your whole life wondering
When it's gonna come or where it's been.
You may have got your heart broken
A few times in the past
Never last as strong as it used to,
It don't feel as good as it used to (before)
And all the things you used to say,
Things you used to do, went right out the door

Ooh no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say
When love won't let you, walk away
And you can't help who you love
And you find yourself giving it all away
When you think you're in love
Ooh cause

[Chorus:]
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when you gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)
I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)
There's a piece of me who leaves when you gone
Because you're sent from (sent from heaven)

Now you can wait your whole life tryna change
What they fear from what it's been
You may have put your whole life into a man
Love aint what you thought it could've been.
Don't wanna swing your change
And you don't feel as good as you used to (before)
And everything you used to say,
Everything you used to do, went right out the door

Ooh no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say
When love won't let you, walk away
And it can't help who it loves
And you find yourself giving it all away
When you think you're in love
Cause I wanna be hey yeah

I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)

5,lil wayne,a milli,R_and_B,"Call the president he's the next new president
He a senator from Illinois yeah
His criteria compared to John Mccain just isn't fair
Cuz he's b-l-a-c- so the eyes are on he
Through is pencil he write
Legislation with the country on his mind
And he don't cope ish
Cuz he ain't got time
Every second minute hour kkk wanna devour
He got guards ready to pop him
With their ch ch ch ch choppers
Every brother mother sister cousin grandma wanna hump him
Even got Hilary Clinton on the side ready to jump him
Tell the Clintons naaaaaaaaah
Couldn't catch him couldn't stop him
They go by the party rules
If you can't beat 'em you can't top 'em
Thought you'd smack couldn't pop em
Delegates couldn't cop 'em
Bill Clinton couldn't help her
Too bad she couldn't drop him

Man Obama so I'll

Obama goes here, Obama goes there
Sayin' yes we can just like Michelle he sittin' in the deriere
He travel to Arizona ready to cause some drama
Hopin' Mccain don't comment
Look at that bastard Obama
He's too young he's too hip
Negroes always causing problems
His pale lookin' face got him lookin' like a goblin
Mccain Mccain please don't vote for Mccain
First they up in office talkin' bout some heart pain
Call the ambulance quick all you hear is sirens
His temper isn't private
Dang I hate a mad prick
Don't you had a mad prick
Plus Mccains an old prick
Barack's a yonger guy so choose him
He's the right pick
But if you choose the wrong pick
Your step-son will probably end up in Iraq quick

His health care plan is so immaculate
So even if you broke you can afford to take a doc trip
You'll be feelin' much better not sick
And he's ok but his wife's sick
And her back's thick and her walk's sick
She's a fly chick
Might hit

Man obama so I'll

He's makin history like x, King, and Douglas
And rfk Obama he s that new black knew that
Red neck said he won't beat john mccain
He don't wear a flag and his middle name's Hussein
But who gon' be that boy dat dat dat boy they call Obama
Got republicans sweatin like they up in saunas
Even Mccains 90 somethin' momma
He ready to pull his lever every hour
And I'd rather eat a field mouse
Than to see John Mccain in the White House
Vote Obama in and I promise you won't turn back
In to some uncle Tom-as
No Aunt Jemima or southern fried chicken
Call him cheif obama or Mr. Keeps on tickin
Man pass the riots comment couldn't pass his tally
Even Oprah Winfrey said that she was right behind him
People I say this country shol' holt without him
But he's gotta go out relate to every body
He do what he do like give his wife a hug then a fist dap
Gotta do that stuff in public so the hood know that he's black
Gotta use big words white people love to hear them
If they hear it they don't fear him they don't know him but they feel him
That's real"

(T-Pain Verse)

Girl I know you feel good
Just like you look
Couple more shots
You open up like a book
I ain't tripping
(Cause I'mma read ya)
I ain't tripping
(I just wanna please ya)
I'mma take a shot of *Nuvo
Shawty didn't you know
It's going down
And we can go and kick it like Judo
You know what I mean
Shawty got drunk, thought it all was a dream
So I made her say, ""Ah, Ah, Ah""
Now she got her hands on my legs
Got my seats all wet in my ride
All over my ride
She look me dead in the eye (eye, eye)
Then my pants got bigger
She already knew what the figure
Had her looking at her boyfriend
Like ""Fuck that Nigga""

(T-Pain Chorus)

Blame it on the juice
Got you feeling loose
Blame it on Petron
Got you in the zone (zone)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol

Blame it on the Vodka
Blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the Blue Tap
Gotcha feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the alcohol (fades)

Now to the Ballers popping bottles
With their Henny in they cups
Screaming ""Money ain't a thing""
And if it ain't, throw it up
In the sky, Hold your drinks up high
And to the independent Ballers
Who can buy they own bottles
And if you looking like a model
When them broke fellas holla
Tell them bye
And hold ya drinks up high
You can...

Blame it on the Goose (goose)
Got you feeling loose (loose)
Blame it on Petron ('tron)
Got you in the zone (zone)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the Vodka

14,keri hilson featuring kanye west & ne-yo,knock you down,R_and_B,"Feat. Kanye West And Ne-Yo

Not again
Oh, this ain't supposed to happen to me

Keep rockin' and keep knockin'
Whether you Louis Vuitton it up or Reebok'n
You see the hate that they servin' on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?

I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race but I've already won first place

I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did
You got me thinkin' 'bout our life, a house and kids, yeah
Every morning I look at you and smile
'Cause boy, you came around and you knocked me down
Knocked me down

Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

I never thought I'd hear myself say
Y'all go ahead, I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today
I used to be commander in chief of my pimp ship flyin' high
'Til I met this pretty little missile, shot me out the sky

Hate to know I'm crashin', don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would baby, if could

Miss independent to the fullest
The load never too much, she helpin' me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight, girl

Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

Tell me now can you make it past your Caspers?
So we can finally fly off into nasa
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
And seemed to only take the head of football teams

And I was the class clown that always kept you laughin'
We were never meant to be baby, we just happened
So please don't mess up the trick
Hey young world I'm the new Slick Rick

They say I move to quick but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hour glass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes

How could a goddess ask someone that's only average for advice
Omg you listen to that bitch? Whoa it's me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it we was magic, I was flyin', now I'm crashin'
This is bad, real bad Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'ma ask 'em

Say you gotta take the good, the bad, happy and the sad
But when you bring a better future than I had in the past
'Cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again

I'll admit it, I was scared to answer love's call
And if it hits better make it worth the first when it comes around

Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around and it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

Won't see it comin' when it happens but when it happens
You're gonna feel it let me tell you now
See when love comes it knocks you down
Won't see it comin' when it happens but when it happens
You're gonna feel it let me tell you now
See when love comes it knocks you down, yeah"

Even know was there.
And you ain't even have to ask twice,
You can have my heart,
Or we can share it like the last slice.
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life,
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life.
Sweat pants, hair tied, chilling with no make-up on,
That's when you're the prettiest,
I hope that you don't take it wrong.
You don't even trip when friends say,
""You ain't bringing Drake along?""
You know that I'm working
I'll be there soon as I make it home.
And she a patient in my waiting room,
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume.
And until them girls prove it,
I'm the one to never get confused with,

Sex, love, Pain;

Buzz so big,
I could probaly sell a blank disk.
When my album drop,
bitches buy for the picture,
And niggas will buy it too,
And claim they got it for their sister.
Magazine paper girl,
The money ain't the issue.
They bring dinner to my room
And ask me to intial.
She call me the referee,
Cause I be so offical,
My shirt ain't got no stripes,
But I can make your pussy whistle.
Like the Andy Griffith theme song,
And who told you to put them jeans on,
Double cuff love,
You the one I lean on,
Feeling for a fix,
Then you should really get your fiend on.
Yeah just know my condo is the crack spot,
Every single show,
She out there repping like a mascot.
Get it from the back,
And make your fucking bra strap pop.
All up in your slot 'till a nigga hit the jackpot.

Your face will be the reason I smile
But I will not see what I cannot have forever
I'll always love ya
I hope you feel the same.

Oh, you played me dirty, your game was so bad
You toyed with my affliction
Had to fill out my prescription
For the remedy
I had to set you free.

Away from me
To see clearly
The way that love can be when you are not with me
I had to lead
I had to love
I had to leave
I had to live

If I can't have you
Let love set you free
To fly your pretty wings around.

Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your
Pretty wings. Pretty wings around.

I came wrong you were right
Transformed your love into a lie
Baby believe me I'm sorry I told you lies

I turned day into night
Sleep till I die a thousand times
I should have showed you better nights, better
Times, better days
And I miss you more and more

If I can't have you
Let love set you free
To fly your pretty wings around

Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your
Pretty wings, Pretty wings around

So Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your
Pretty wings, Pretty wings around

When ya no longer involved that person has it all,

To a condo downtown because it's all about location,
I sit and drink wine and watch californication of life,
You shoulda been here to kick it with me,
We coulda split this whole thing up 50/50,
But now I'm at the 40-/40 getting b-tches tipsy,
Killing sh-t the ever so talented Mr Ripley,
How I go from being the man that you argue with,
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest sh-t,
I should wanna go back to the one I started with,
But I'm addicted to this life it's gonna be hard to quit,
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along,

I hate liars, fucklove I'm tired of tryin

Different That's why I'm gonna take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again
About how reckless I have been and I'm slowly running
Out of all the time that I invested Making all the same
Mistakes and I'm just trying to correct it and I fall

For your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type [ohhohh]
For your type

I fly with the stars in the skies
I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live doesn't mean you're alive
Don't worry bout me and who I fire
I get what I desire, it's my empire
And yes I call the shots I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon a vampire
In this very moment I'm king
In this very moment I slay Goliath with a sling
This very moment I bring, put it on everything
That I will retire with the ring
And I will retire with the crown, Yes!
No I'm not lucky I'm blessed, Yes!
Clap for the heavyweight champ, Me!
But I couldn't do it all alone, We!
Young Money raised me,grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens and it's crazy
Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when were done, this moment will be syndicated
I don't know...this night just reminds me of
Everything that they deprived me of, KUH!!
P-p-p-p-p-put ya drinks up,
It's a celebration, every time we link up
We done did everything, they can think of
Greatness, is what we on the brink of

Shoutout to the CEO 500 degrees
Shoutout to the OVO, red wings and fatigues, oooow

This supposed to be y'all year, we ain't get the memo
Young King, pay me in gold

Weezy on top and that person ain't even home, yet!
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers getting bodied and carried away

And now you people that be hatin' can catch the bouquet, oww
Yeah, you a star in my eyes, you and all them white girls party of five
Are we drinking a lil more I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it I'm partly surprised, I swear
Darn, this one for the books, man!
I swear this stuff is as fun as it looks, man!
I'm really tryna make it more than what it is
Cause everybody dies but not everybody lives!

And what's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy

But get it while you here boy
Cause all that hype don't feel the same next year boy
Yeah and I'll be right here in my spot with a little more cash than I
Already got
Trippin off you cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient, me and 40 back to work but we still smell
Like a vacation
Hate the rumours, hate your bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations, I'm just feeling like the throne is for the
Taking
Watch me take it!

Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognise the red bottoms I wear
Burner in the belt
Move the kids to the hills (BOSS)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
Even though I out on bond I might be facin' 8′s
Still running with the same niggas til the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
In a room full of money out in London and she screams

Devil on my shoulders the lord is my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighing sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch but just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge I'm dangling my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me nosebleed seats
And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drumset
I've been at the top for a while and I aint jumped yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump on that dick and do a full split

Chorus Drake:
He just started to pop it for a nigga then looked back and told me baby it's
Real
And I say I aint doubt you for a second I squeeze it and I can tell how it
Feels
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
She bad so maybe she wont uh but shit then again maybe she will
Yeah do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin game right now she will 2x
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin game right now she will.

Wayne:
I tell her now gon and pop that pussy for me
Haters can't see me but them bitches still looking for me
You can take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about ""I"" give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick not just kinda fine
Eat her till she cry call it wine and dine
Try to check me and ima have em checkin poses
They say choose wisely that's why I was chosen
Rockin like asphalt it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of death and took it's mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Jump up on that dick and do a full split

And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my mo add a B to that shit

Nigga money talks and Mr. Ed!

Ain't shit sweet niggas on the street like hookers

Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

Beat her to my mattress

It's probably a pussy ass nigga

Got ya car note in my cup
And your rent in my swisha
Pussy so good I miss ya

I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
For wanting my cake, and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
When I blew; see, but it was confusing
Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
(Ooh!) Hit the lottery, oh wee
But with what I gave up to get was bittersweet
It was like winning a used mink
Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink

Once told me to seize the moment and don't squander it
Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder
Where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, ponder it, do you want this?
No wonder you losing your mind, the way it wanders)
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo
I think you've been wandering off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
Cause I need an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I love's killing me and I can't conquer it
My OCD is conking me in the head

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Well, that's nothing

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed
And I'm coming straight at MCs, blood get spilled
And I take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played at, pumped up feeling
And shit to say back to the kids who play 'em
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels and then relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back in the draft
Turn nothing into something, still can make that, straw into gold chump
I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket face facts, I am nuts for real
But I'm okay with that, it's nothing, I'm still friends with the...

Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us ain't no place in between
By me believing what you say that you never mean
Like It'll last for ever but now forever ain't as long

You was different from my last but now you got a mirror
But as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer

Nigga now you see me, nigga now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx, acting like Ray Charles
16 in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully, with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from ""poor me""
To ""please pour me a drink and celebrate with me""

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only"
61,taylor swift,our song,Country,"I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart

I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothing I was just thinking
How we don't have a song"" and he says

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know

Our song is the way you laugh
The first date man, I didn't kiss her and I should have
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen
Asking God if He could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away

Got to the hallway, well, on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know

Our song is the way you laugh
The first date man, I didn't kiss her and I should have
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen
Asking God if He could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know

Our song is the way he laughs
The first date man, I didn't kiss him and I should have
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen
Asking God if He could play it again
Play it again, oh, yeah, oh, oh, yeah

I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song"
62,brad paisley,letter to me,Country,"If I could write a letter to me
And send it back in time to myself at seven-teen
First I'd prove it's me by sayin'
Look under your bed, there's a Skoal can and a Playboy
No one else would know you hid
And then I'd say I know it's tough
When you break up after seven months
And yeah I know you really liked her
And it just don't seem fair
But all I can say is pain like that is fast and it's rare

And oh you got so much goin' for you
Goin' right
But I know at seven-teen
It's hard to see past Friday night
She wasn't right for you
And still you feel like there's
A knife stickin' out of your back
And you're wonderin' if you'll survive
But you'll make it through this and you'll see
You're still around to write this letter to me

At the stop sign at Tomlinson and 8th
Always stop completely, don't just tap your brakes
And when you get a date with Bridgette
Make sure the tank is full
On second thought forget it, that one turns out kinda cool.
Each and every time you have a fight
Just assume you're wrong and daddy's right.
And you should really thank Miss Brinkman
She spent so much extra time
It's like she sees the diamond underneath
And she's polishin' you 'til you shine.

And oh you got so much goin' for you
Goin' right
But I know at seventeen
It's hard to see past Friday night
Tonight's the bonfire rally
But you're staying home instead
Because if you fail algebra
Mom and dad'll kill you dead
Trust me you'll squeak by and get a C
And you're still around to write this letter to me

You got so much up ahead
You'll make new friends
You should see your kids and wife
And I'd end by sayin' have no fear
These are nowhere near
The best years of your life

I guess I'll see you in the mirror
When you're a grown man
P. S. Go hug aunt Rita every chance you can

And oh you got so much goin' for you
Goin' right
But I know at seventeen
It's hard to see past Friday night
I wish you'd study Spanish
I wish you'd take a typing class
I wish you wouldn't worry let it be
I'd say have a little faith and you'll see

If I could write a letter to me
To me..."
65,alan jackson,small town southern man,Country,"Born the middle son of a farmer
And a small town Southern man
Like his daddy's daddy before him
Brought up workin' on the land
Fell in love with a small town woman
And they married up and settled down
Natural way of life if you're lucky
For a small town Southern man

First there came four pretty daughters
For this small town Southern man
Then a few years later came another
A boy, he wasn't planned
Seven people livin' all together
In a house built with his own hands
Little words with love and understandin'
From a small town Southern man

[Chorus:]
And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman
(He) was always proud of what he had
He said his greatest contribution
Is the ones you leave behind
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man
(Raised on the ways and gentle kindness)
(Of a small town Southern man)

Callous hands told the story
For this small town Southern man
He gave it all to keep it all together
And keep his family on his land
Like his daddy, years wore out his body
Made it hard just to walk and stand
You can break the back
But you can't break the spirit
Of a small town Southern man

(Repeat Chorus)

Finally death came callin'
For this small town Southern man
He said it's alright 'cause I see angels
And they got me by the hand
Don't you cry, and don't you worry
I'm blessed, and I know I am
'Cause God has a place in Heaven
For a small town Southern man

(Repeat Chorus)"
66,trace adkins,you're gonna miss this,Country,"She was starin out the window of their suv
Complainin sayin I can't wait to turn 18
She said I'll make my own money
And I'll make my own rules
Momma put the car in park out there in front of the school
And she kissed her head, and said
'i was just like you'
You're gonna' miss this
You're gonna' want this back
You're gonna' wish these days
Hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna' miss this
Before she knows it she's a brand new bride
In her one bedroom apartment
And her daddy stops by
He tells her it's a nice place
She says, 'It'll do for now'
Starts talkin' about babies, and buyin a house
Daddy shakes his head
And says baby just slow down
Cuz' you're gonna' miss this
You're gonna' want this back
You're gonna' wish these days
Hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now

Workin' on the water heater
Dog's barkin', phone's ringin'
One kid's cryin' one kid's screamin'
And she keeps apologizin'
He says they don't bother me
I've got two babies of my own
One's thirty- six, one's twenty- three
Huh, it's hard to believe

You're gonna' want this back
You're gonna' wish these days

67,george strait,i saw god today,Country,"Just walked down the street to the coffee shop
Had to take a break
I'd been by her side for 18 hours straight
Saw a flower growin' in the middle of the sidewalk
Pushin' up through the concrete
Like it was planted right there for me to see
The flashin' lights
The honkin' horns
All seemed to fade away
In the shadow of that hospital at 5: 08
I saw God today

I've been to church
I've read the book
I know he's here
But I don't look
Near as often as I should
Yeah, I know I should
His fingerprints are everywhere
I just slowed down to stop and stare
Opened my eyes and man I swear
I saw God today

Saw a couple walkin' by they were holdin' hands
Man she had that glow
Yeah I couldn't help but notice she was startin' to show it
Stood there for a minute takin' the sky
Lost in that sunset
Splash of amber melted in the shades of red

I've been to church
I've read the book
I know he's here
But I don't look
Near as often as I should
Yeah, I know I should
His fingerprints are everywhere
I just slowed down to stop and stare
Opened my eyes and man I swear
I saw God today

Got my face pressed up against the nursery glass
She's sleepin' like a rock
My name on her wrist
Wearin' tiny pink socks
She's got my nose, she's got her mama's eyes
My brand new baby girl
She's a miracle
I saw God today"

But two days in Heaven just ain't gonna do

2nd Verse

What's the point in fightin' what we're feelin'
We both know we'll never win
Ain't this what we're missin'
Let's just stop all this resistin' and give in

69,brad paisley,i'm still a guy,Country,"When you see a deer you see Bambi
And I see antlers up on the wall
When you see a lake you think picnic
And I see a large mouth up under that log
You're probably thinking that you're going to change me
In some ways well maybe you might
Scrub me down, dress me up but no matter what
Remember, I'm still a guy

When you see a priceless French painting
I see a drunk, naked girl
You think that riding a wild bull sounds crazy
And I'd like to give it a whirl
Well love makes a man do some things he ain't proud of
And in a weak moment I might walk your sissy dog, hold your purse at the mall
But remember, I'm still a guy

I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by

I can hear you now talking to your friends
Saying, ""Yeah girls he's come a long way""
From dragging his knuckles and carrying a club

And building a fire in a cave
But when you say a backrub means only a backrub
Then you swat my hand when I try
Well, what can I say at the end of the day
Honey, I'm still a guy

I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by

These days there's dudes getting facials
Manicured, waxed and botoxed
With deep spray-on tans and creamy lotion in your hands
You can't grip a tacklebox

With all of these men lining up to get neutered
It's hip now to be feminized
I don't highlight my hair
I've still got a pair
Yeah honey, I'm still a guy

Oh my eyebrows ain't plucked
There's a gun in my truck
Oh thank God, I'm still a guy"
70,carrie underwood,last name,Country,"Last night, I got served a little bit too much of that poison baby
Last night, I did things I'm not proud of
And I got a little crazy
Last night, I met a guy on the dance floor and I let him call me baby

And I don't even know his last name
My momma would be so ashamed
It started off, hey cutie where you from
And then it turned into oh no, what have I done
And I don't even know his last name

And we left the club right around 3 o'clock in the mornin'
His Pinto, sitting there, in the parking lot, well it should've been a warnin'
And I had no clue what I was gettin' into
So, I'll blame it on the Cuervo

Oh, where did my manners go?

And I don't even know his last name
My momma would be so ashamed
It started off, hey cutie where you from
And then it turned into oh no, what have I done
And I don't even know his last name

Here we go

Today, I woke up, thinkin' 'bout Elvis somewhere in Vegas
I'm not sure how I got here
Or how this ring on my left hand just appeared outta nowhere
I gotta go, I take the chips and the Pinto and hit the road
They say what happens here, stays here, all of this'll disappear

There's just one little problem

I don't even know my last name
My momma would be so ashamed
It started off, hey cutie where you from
And then it turned into oh no, what have I done
And I don't even know my last name

What have I done
What have I done
What have I done

Oh, what have I done
I don't even know my last name

Well it turned into, oh no what have I done
And I don't even know my last name
Yea, Yeah, Yeah

It started off hey cutie where you from
And then it turned into, oh no what have I done
And I don't even know my last name
Oh, yeah"
71,kenny chesney,better as a memory,Country,"I move on like a sinners prayer
And letting go like a levee breaks
Walk away as if I don't care
Learn to shoulder my mistakes
Or built to fade like your favorite song
Get reckless when there's no need
Laugh as your stories ramble on
Break my heart, but it won't bleed
My only friends are pirates
That's just who I am
But I'm better as a memory than as your man

Never sure when the truth won't do
And pretty good on a lonely night
Or move on the way a storm blows through
And never stay, but then again, I might.
I struggle sometimes to find the words
Always sure until I doubt
Walk a line until it blurs
Build walls too high to climb out
But I'm honest to a fault
That's just who I am
I'm better as a memory than as your man

I see you leaning, you're bound to fall
I don't want to be that mistake
I'm just a dreamer and nothing more
You should know it before it gets too late

Cause goodbyes are like a roulette wheel
You never know where they're gonna land
First you're spinning, then you're standing still
Left holding a losing hand
But one day you're gonna find someone
And right away you'll know it's true
That all of your seekings done
It was just a part of the passing through
Right there in that moment you'll finally understand
That I was better as a memory than as your man
Better as a memory than as your man"
72,montgomery gentry,back when i knew it all,Country,"At the ripe old age of nineteen
I bought a short bed pick up chicks machine
Life ran on beer and gasoline
A half a lap ahead of the law
I had a fake I d that got me into ""tuffies""
Love was a word I used to get lucky
Was a big time spender with that plastic money
Back when I knew it all

Back when the world was flat and
Mama and daddy didn't have a clue
That was back
Back when a pitcher of beer and a
Couple shots made me bulletproof
Back when god was a name I used in vain
To get a point across when I got ticked off
Lord I'm learning so much more than
Back when I knew it all

I found out credit cards don't mean you're rich
And beer and gasoline don't mix
Yeah step side trucks can't jump a ditch
And those ""big house"" rooms sure are small
I've learned that love is a woman that will settle you down
A sunday sermon can turn life around
Man I can't believe all the answers I've found
Since, back when I knew it all

Back when the world was flat and
Mama and daddy didn't have a clue
That was back
Back when a pitcher of beer and a
Couple shots made me bulletproof
Back when god was a name I used in vain
To get a point across when I got ticked off
Lord I'm learning so much more than
Back when I knew it all

I've done some growing up
And I'm still growing up
So I know I'll never be
As smart as I once was
That was back

Back when the world was flat and
Mama and daddy didn't have a clue
That was back
Back when a pitcher of beer and a
Couple shots made me bulletproof
Back when god was a name I used in vain

That you'd take it all back,

It was a moment of weakness

You should've said no,
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known the word of what you did with her'd

And I should've been there,
In the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet

Baby and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
And baby you know all the right things
To say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same
You say that the past is the past,
You need one chance

It had been a long time, but later last night
Baby, we caught up real fast

And maybe it's a little too early
To know if this is gonna work
All I know is you're sure looking
Good in my shirt

Every way that we went wrong

He sat down in his overalls and asked me
You waitin' on a woman
I nodded yeah and said how 'bout you
He said son since nineteen fifty-two I've been
Waitin' on a woman

When I picked her up for our first date
I told her I'd be there at eight
And she came down the stairs at eight-thirty
She said I'm sorry that I took so long
Didn't like a thing that I tried on
But let me tell you son she sure looked pretty
Yeah she'll take her time but I don't mind
Waitin' on a woman

He said the wedding took a year to plan
You talk about an anxious man, I was nervous
Waitin' on a woman
And then he nudged my arm like old men do
And said, I'll say this about the honeymoon, it was worth it
Waitin' on a woman

And I don't guess we've been anywhere
She hasn't made us late I swear
Sometimes she does it just 'cause she can do it
Boy it's just a fact of life
It'll be the same with your young wife
Might as well go on and get used to it
She'll take her time 'cause you don't mind
Waitin' on a woman

I've read somewhere statistics show
The man's always the first to go
And that makes sense 'cause I know she won't be ready
So when it finally comes my time
And I get to the other side
I'll find myself a bench, if they've got any
I hope she takes her time, 'cause I don't mind
Waitin' on a woman

Honey, take your time, cause I don't mind
Waitin' on a woman"

Don't think I don't have regrets
Don't think it don't get to me

Don't think I don't wonder bout
Could've been should've been all worked out

I know what I felt and I know what I said
But don't think I don't think about it

When we make choices
We gotta live with it
Heard you found a real good man and you married him

I wonder if sometime I cross your mind?
Where would we be today of if I never drove that car away?

But don't think I don't think about it
Don't think I don't have regrets

81,kenny chesney,everybody wants to go to heaven,Country,"Preacher told me last Sunday mornin'
Son, you better start livin' right
You need to quit the women and whiskey
And carrying on all night

Don't you wanna hear him call your name
When you're standin' at the pearly gates
I told the preacher, ""Yes I do""
But I hope they don't call today
I ain't ready

Everybody wants to go to heaven
Have a mansion high above the clouds
Everybody want to go to heaven
But nobody want to go now

Said preacher maybe you didn't see me
Throw an extra twenty in the plate
There's one for everything I did last night
And one to get me through today
Here's a ten to help you remember
Next time you got the good Lord's ear
Say I'm comin' but there ain't no hurry
I'm havin' fun down here
Don't you know that

Everybody wants to go to heaven
Get their wings and fly around
Everybody want to go to heaven
But nobody want to go now

Someday I want to see those streets of gold in my halo
But I wouldn't mind waiting at least a hundred years or so

Everybody wanna go to heaven
It beats the other place there ain't no doubt
Everybody wanna go to heaven
But nobody wanna go now

Everybody wanna go to heaven
Hallelujah, let me hear you shout
Everybody wanna go to heaven
But nobody wanna go now

83,toby keith,she never cried in front of me,Country,"Seven thirty five
She's someone's else wife
I can get on with my life
And that thrills me
She married him today
Her daddy gave the bride away
I heard a tear rolled down her face
And that kills me
Cause now I, can see why
She's finally cryin'

How was I supposed to know
She was slowly letting go
If I was putting her through Hell
Hell I couldn't tell
She could've given me a sign
And opened up my eyes
How was I supposed to see
She never cried in front of me

Yeah maybe I might've changed
It's hard for me to say
But the story's still the same
And it's a sad one
And I'll always believe
If she ever did cry for me
They were tears that you can't see
You know the bad ones
And now I, can see why
She's finally cryin'

Repeat chourus

Without a doubt
I know now
How it oughta be
Cause she's gone & it's wrong
And it bothers me
Tomorrow I'll still be
Asking myself

How was I supposed to know
She was slowly letting go
If I was putting her through hell
Hell I couldn't tell
She could've given me a sign
And opened up my eyes
How was I supposed to see
How was I supposed to see
She never cried in front of me

Hell I couldn't tell"
84,carrie underwood,just a dream,Country,"It was two weeks after the day she turned eighteen
All dressed in white
Going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Six pence in her shoe, something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down
Trying to hide the tears
Oh she just couldn't believe it
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hands.

Baby why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

The preacher man said let us bow our heads and pray
Lord please lift his soul, and heal this hurt
Then the congregation all stood up and sang
The saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
Oh, and what could have been
And then the guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart

Baby why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance
Standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

Oh,
Baby why'd you leave me
Why'd you have to go?
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
Oh, I'll never know
It's like I'm looking from a distance

This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream

Oh, this is just a dream
Just a dream

85,taylor swift,love story,Country,"[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes
And the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights
See the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello, little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go, and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say yes

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say yes

Romeo save me, they're tryin to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say yes

Oh oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

[Chorus 3]
Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say yes

[Outro]
Oh, oh,
Oh, oh
Cause we were both young when I first saw you..."
86,zac brown band,chicken fried,Country,"You know I like my chicken fried
A cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

And it's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive, or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind this I've come to know
So if you agree have a drink with me
Raise you glasses for a toast

To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring
Salute the ones who died
And the ones that give their lives, so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

Like our chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I've seen the sunrise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love"

Get to living my life
Making sure that I'm all that I can be
Went to church on Sunday
There was a moment that came
I swear it was like the Lord spoke right to me

So now I'm slowing it down and I'm looking around
And I'm lovin' this town and I'm doing alright
Aint' worried 'bout nothing except the man I wanna be
I'm thinking it's time to be livin' the rhyme
When I'm singing a song about nothing but right
And it'd sure be nice if you would roll with me

Saw a kid last winter only twenty years old
Being laid to rest while his mom stood by his side
Sure was hard to watch those tears roll down her face
Made me think how we all just have our time

So now I'm slowing it down and I'm looking around
And I'm lovin/ this town and I'm doing alright
Aint' worried 'bout nothing except the man I wanna be
I'm thinking it's time to be livin' the rhyme
When I'm singing a song about nothing but right

Who knows what's ahead
I think I'd rather not know instead

Here comes goodbye, here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain, Here comes me wishing things would never change
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye

I can hear her say ""I love you"" like it was yesterday
And I can see it written on her face that she had never felt this way
One day I thought I'd see her with her daddy by her side
And violins would play ""here comes the bride""

Here comes goodbye, here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain, Here comes me wishing things would never change
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye

Why does it have to go from to good to gone?
Before the lights turn on, yeah and you're left alone
All alone, but here comes goodbye

Which hands you shake and which hands you hold
In my hand-me-down Mercury, ready to roll
She knew that I had to go
And hangout, make lots of noise
And lay out, late with a boy
Make the mistakes that she made 'cause she knew all along

I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
Life is a runaway train you can't wait to jump on

They say the first time won't ever last
But that didn't stop me, the first time he laughed
All my friends tried to warn me the day that we met
""Girl, don't you lose your heart yet""
But his dark eyes dared me with danger
And sparks fly like flame to a paper
Fire in his touch burnin' me up, but still I held on 'cause

I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
Life is a runaway train you can't wait to jump on

The last time I saw him, we packed up my things
And he smiled like the first time he told me his name
And we cried with each other
We spread the blame for the parts, that we couldn't change
Pictures, dishes and socks
It's our whole life down to one box
There he was waving goodbye on the front porch alone

But I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
Hangout, make lots of noise
And lay out late with a boy
Make the mistakes that she made, life is a runaway train

Which hands to shake, which hands you hold
In my hand-me-down Mercury

Fire in his touch

I sip a little coffee, and I drink a little booze

'Cause I'm an all American country boy
I'm my daddy's spittin' image and my mama's pride and joy
There ain't nothing down home that I really don't enjoy
'Cause I'm an all American country boy

I drive a pickup truck and I don't pass the buck
And I always speak my mind
I'm hooked on T.V., Rolaids, and B.C.'s
And I know how to have a good time
I'm a little bit rowdy and a little bit tame
Ain't no way I'm ever gonna change

'Cause I'm an all American country boy
I'm my daddy's spittin' image and my mama's pride and joy
There ain't nothing down home that I really don't enjoy
'Cause I'm an all American country boy

Well I must admit that I've mellowed a bit
Father Time can slow you down

It just takes a little longer now

'Cause I'm an all American country boy

The one that lets her know for sure
She's everything I want and more.
Her real desire.
And to know I'd walk alone out on the wire... To make her feel that fire.

She wants a cabin in the woods.
She wants to stand where nobody stood.
Someday she wants a couple kids of her own.
She wants to make love on a train.
Someday she only wants a break

I saw a sign for lemonade
They were the cutest kids
I'd ever seen in this front yard

As they handed me my glass
Smiled and thinkin' to myself
Man what a picture perfect postcard this would make
Of America

It's a high school prom
It's a springstein song
It's a ride in a cheverlet
It's a man on the moon
And fireflies in June
Kids sellin lemonade
It's cities and farms
It's open arms
One nation under God
It's America

Later on when I got home
I flipped the T. V on
I saw a little town that some big
Twister tore apart
People came from miles around
Just to help their neighbors out
And I was thinkin' to my self
I'm so glad that I live in America

It's a high school prom
It's a springstein song
It's a ride in a cheverlet
It's a man on the moon
And fireflies in June
Kids sellin lemonade
It's cities and farms
It's open arms
One nation under God
It's America

Now we don't always get it all right
But there's no place else I'd rather build my life

Cause it's a kid with a chance
It's a rock n roll band
It's a farmer cuttin' hay

It's a big flag flyin' in the summer wind
Over a fallen hero's grave.

It's a high school prom
It's a springstein song
It's a welcome home parade

And fireflies in June

It's cities and farms
It's open arms

Let go, laughing
Life don't go quite like you planned it
We try so hard to understand it
The irrefutable, indisputable fact is
Pshhhhh, it happens

My trusty rusty had a flat
I borrowed my neighbors Cadillac
""I'll be right back,"" going down to Wally World
That yellow light turned red too quickly
Knew that truck the moment it hit me
Out stepped my ex and his new girl
(""Sorry 'bout your neck baby"")

But it's poor me, why me, oh me, boring
The same old worn out blah, blah story
There's no good explanation for it at all

Ain't no rhyme or reason
No complicated meaning
Ain't no need to over think it
Let go, laughing
Life don't go quite like you planned it
We try so hard to understand it
The irrefutable, indisputable fact is
It happens

Ain't no rhyme or reason
No complicated meaning
Ain't no need to over think it
Let go, laughing
Life don't go quite like you planned it
We try so hard to understand it
The irrefutable, indisputable fact is

Yeah, the irrefutable, indisputable, absoluteable, totally beautiful fact is
Pshhhhh, it happens"
103,brad paisley,then,Country,"I remember trying not to stare
The night that I first met you,
You had me mesmerized,
And three weeks later,
In the front porch light,
Taking 45 minutes to kiss goodnight.
I hadn't told you then,
That I thought I loved you then

And now you're my whole life,
And now you're my whole world,
And I just can't believe the way I feel about you girl,
Like a river meets the sea, stronger than it's ever been,
We've come so far since that day,
And I thought I loved you then

And I remember taking you back to right where I first met you,
You were so surprised.
There were people around, but I didn't care,
I got down on one knee right there,
And once again
I thought I loved you then

And now you're my whole life,
Now you're my whole world,
And I just can't believe the way I feel about you girl,
Like a river meets the sea, stronger than it's ever been,
We've come so far since that day,
And I thought I loved you then

I can just see you, with a baby on the way
I can just see you, when your hair is turning gray
What I can't see is how I'm ever gonna love you more
But I've said that before

And now your my whole life
Now your my whole world
I just can't believe the way I feel about you girl,
We'll look back someday at this moment that we're in
And I'll look at you and say
And I thought I loved you then
And I thought I loved you then"
104,kenny chesney,out last night,Country,"We went out last night
Like we swore we wouldn't do
Drank too much beer last night
A lot more than we wanted to

There were girls from Argentina and Arkansas
Maine, Alabama and Panama
All mixed together and having a ball

Yeah, we went went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother

There were two karaoke girls drunk on a dare
Singing ""I Got You Babe"" by Sonny and Cher
Yeah, life was good everywhere
We went out last night

Well you know I'm a music man
I grew up in east Tennessee
Well last night I was everything
When I got a few drinks in me

I was a doctor, a lawyer, a senator's son
Brad Pitt's brother and a man on the run
Anything I thought would get the job done

Yeah, we went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother

There were people doing body shots up on the bar
Jimmy in a fist fight out by the car
Everybody was some kind of star
When we went out last night

Well the fact that I'm still breathing
Means that I must have survived
And that I lived to go out with my friends again tonight

Oh, we went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Everybody started loving on each other

They were dancing on the tables and howling at the moon
Pairing up together and pretty soon
There was not a soul in sight
When we went out last night"
105,dierks bentley,sideways,Country,"Verse I
Hey girl, what's your name?
It's so loud in here I can't hear a thing, 
But I sure do like your style, 
And I can see you came to rock 
In your blue jeans and white tank top; 
Man that look drives me wild.

(Chorus)
And it's hey now here we go.
D-j don't you play nothing slow
Keep those girls out on the floor
Gotta make them want to come back for more.
Been here since the sun went down, 
Be here when it comes back around
Worked all week it's time to play
Gonna get a little bit sideways... 
Sideways.

Verse II
Ain't no need to fight
Y'all take that redneck stuff outside
That's what parking lots are for.
Once you're out you ain't coming back
The man on the ropes ain't got no slack.
Man they're busting down the door! 

(Chorus)
And it's hey now here we go 
D-J don't you play nothing slow

I run from prejudice
I run from pessimists

I run my life
Or is it running me?
Run from my past, I run too fast
Or too slow it seems

When lies become the truth
That's when I run to you

[Chorus:]
This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster so I run to you
I run to you, baby
And when it all starts coming undone
Baby, you're the only one I run to
I run to you

We run on fumes
Your life and mine
Like the sands of time
Slippin' right on through

And our love's the only truth
That's why I run to you

This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster so I run to you
I run to you, baby

107,billy currington,people are crazy,Country,"This old man and me, were at the bar and we
Were having us some beers and swaping I don't cares
Talking politics, blonde and red-head chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and habits we aint kicked

We talked about Gods grace and all the hell we raised
Then I heard the ol' man say;
God is great, beer is good and People Are Crazy

He said ""I fought two wars,
Been married and divorced""
What brings you to Ohio?
He said ""Damned if I know""
We talked an hour or two about every girl we knew
What all we put them through
Like two old boys will do

We pondered life an death
He light a cigarette
He said ""These damn things will kill me yet;
But God is great, beer is good and people are crazy""

Last call it's 2am, I said goodbye to him
I never talk to him again
Then one sunny day, I saw the old mans face
Front page Obituary, he was a millionaree
He left his fortune to some guy he barely knew, his kids were mad as hell
But me, I'm doing well
And I drop by today, to just say thanks and pray, I left a six-pack right there on his grave and I said; God is great,
Beer is good, and people are crazy.

God is great, beer is good, and people are crazy.

God is great, beer is good, and people are crazy."

Lay on a blanket and stare up at the moon
It may not be no French Riviera

May be a simple life but that's okay, yeah
If you ask me baby I think I got it made

I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you'll wake up and find
That what you're lookin for has been here the whole time

Been here all along so why can't you see?
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walkin the streets with you and your all worn out jeans,
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on the park bench thinkin to myself
Hey isn't this easy?

And you've got that smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in awhile, since she brought you down
You say you fine I know you better than that
Hey, Whatcha doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you'll wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see?
You belong with me

Standin by, I'm waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me

Oh I remember you driving to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're about to cry
I know your favorite songs and you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong. I think I know it's with me.

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along so why can't you see?
You belong with me

Standing by, I'm waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know baby
You belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me"

She had on a new dress and she curled her hair,
She was looking too good not to go somewhere,
Said what you want to do baby I don't care,
We can go to the show we can stay out here,

And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor,
We can go slow or make it go faster,
Down through the woods and out to the pasture,
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter,
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to,
Girl you know you got me to hold on to,
We can go to town but baby if you'd rather,
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor,

Said we can fire it up and I can show you around,
Sit upon the hill and watch the sun go down,
When the fireflies are dancing and the moon comes out,
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house,

Or we can take you for a ride on my big green tractor,
We can go slow or make it go faster,
Down through the woods and out to the pasture,
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter,
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to,
Girl you know you got me to hold on to,
We can go to town but baby if you'd rather,
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor,

Just let me dust off the seat,
Mmmmmm put your pretty little arms around me,
Hell yeah,

That's why
We can roll with the punches
We can stroll hand in hand
And when I say it's forever
You understand

That you're always in my heart,
You're always on my mind
But when it all becomes too much,
You're never far behind
And there's no one that comes close to you
Could ever take your place
Cause only you can love me this way

I could have turned a different corner
I could have gone another place
Then I'd of never had this feeling
That I feel today, yeah...

And you're always in my heart,
Always on my mind
When it all becomes too much,
You're never far behind
And there's no one that comes close to you

Life is good today. Life is good today.
Well, the plane touched down just about 3 o'clock
And the city's still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line
Concrete and cars are their own prison bars like this life I'm living in
But the plane brought me farther.
I'm surrounded by water
And I'm not going back again

Yeah I'm leaving GA
And if it weren't for tequila and pretty senoritas
I'd have no reason to stay
Adios and vaya con dios
Yeah I'm leaving GA
Gonna lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one
And grab my guitar and play

Four days flew by like a drunk Friday night as the summer drew to an
End
They can't believe that I just couldn't leave
And I bid adieu to my friends
Cause my bartender she's from the islands
Her body's been kissed by the sun
And coconut replaces the smell of the bar and I don't know if it's her or
The rum

I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today. Life is good today.

Adios and vaya con dios
A long way from GA
Yeah, and all the muchachas they call me ""big poppa"" when I throw
Pesos their way
Adios and vaya con dios
A long way from GA
Someone do me a favor and pour me some Jager
I'll grab my guitar and play

Adios and vaya con dios
Going home now to stay
The senoritas don't care-o when there's no dinero
I got no money to stay
Adios and vaya con dios
Going home now to stay

I'm just gunna prop up by the lake
I've got my ass in a lawn chair
Toes in the clay
Not a worry in the world a PBR on the way

And you're wondering why you can't get free
He's like a curse, he's like a drug
You get addicted to his love
You wanna get out, but he's holding you down
'Cause you can't live without one more touch

He's a good time, cowboy casanova
Leaning up against the record machine
He looks like a cool drink of water
But he's candy-coated misery
He's the devil in disguise
A snake with blue eyes
And he only comes out at night
Gives you feelings that you don't want to fight
You better run for your life

I see that look on your face
You ain't hearing what I say
So I'll say it again
'Cause I've been where you've been
And I know how it ends
You can't get away
Don't even look in his eyes
He'll tell you nothing but lies
And you wanna believe
But you won't be deceived
If you listen to me
And take my advice

I'm all alone and I need you now.
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control
And I need you now.
And I don't know how I can do without, 
I just need you now.

Another shot of whiskey, 
Can't stop looking at the door.
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before.

We're at a crossroads here

If I'm not the one thing, you can't stand to lose
If I'm not the arrow to the heart of you
If you don't get drunk, on my kiss
If you think you can do better than this
Then I guess we're done
Let's not drag this on
Consider me gone

With you I've always been wide open
Like a window or an ocean
There is nothin' I've ever tried to hide
So when you leave me, not knowin' where you're goin'
I start thinkin' that we're lookin'
We're lookin' at goodbye
How about a strong bout a strong shot of honesty?
Don't you owe that to me?

If I'm not the one thing, you can't stand to lose
If I'm not the arrow to the heart of you
If you don't get drunk, on my kiss
If you think you can do better than this
Then I guess we're done
Let's not drag this on
Consider me gone

Consider me a memory
Consider me the past
Consider me a smile in an old photograph
Someone who used to make you laugh

If I'm not the one thing, you can't stand to lose
If I'm not the arrow to the heart of you

Or have a Bubba in the family tree, to get on down with me,
Yeah Bubba all you need is an open mind,
If it fires you up you gotta let it shine,
When it feels so right that it can't be wrong,
Come on come on come on you ain't alone you ain't alone.

We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide,
When the band starts bangin and the fiddle saws,
You can't help but hollerin' yee-Haw!
When you see them pretty lil' country queens
Man you gotta admit that it's in them jeans,
Ain't nothing wrong just getting on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone bone

Imagine a dirt road full of potholes, 
With a creek bank and some cane poles catchin channel cat, 
I'm a little more country than that, 

Bridge 2:
Picture a small town, with an old hound, 
Layin out front of the courthouse, 
While the ol men chew the fat, 
I'm a little more country than that,

I just want to make sure you know just who your gettin under this old hat, 
Cause girl I'm just not the kind of two time or play games behind your back,

Think of a Hank song, from days gone, 
With a steel ride, that's so strong, it sends chills up your back, 
I'm a little more country than that

If you want to break home in a school zone, 
With the doors locked and alarms on, 
Girl you way of track, 
I'm a little more country than that

125,carrie underwood,temporary home,Country,"Little boy, six years old
A little too used to being alone
Another new mom and dad, another school
Another house that'll never be home

When people ask him how he likes this place
He looks up and says with a smile upon his face

This is my temporary home
It's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is my temporary home

Mmmmm

A young mom on her own
She needs a little help, got no where to go
She's looking for a job, looking for a way out
'Cause a half-way house will never be a home

At night she whispers to her baby girl
Someday we'll find our place here in this world

This is our temporary home
It's not where we belong
Windows and rooms that we're passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where we're going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is our temporary home

Old man, hospital bed
The room is filled with people he loves
And he whispers, ""don't cry for me,
I'll see you all someday""

He looks up and says,
""I can see God's face""

This is my temporary home
It's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This was just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This was my temporary home

Mmmmm

This is our temporary home"
126,zac brown band,highway 20 ride,Country,"I ride east every other Friday but if I had it my way
A day would not be wasted on this drive
And I want so bad to hold you
Son there's things I haven't told you
Your mom and me couldn't get along

So I'll drive
And I'll think about my life
And wonder why, that I'll slowly die inside
Every time I turn that truck around, right at the Georgia line and I count the days and the miles back home to you on that Highway 20 ride

A day might come you'll realize that if you see through my eyes
There was no other way to work it out
And a part of you might hate me
But son please don't mistake me for a man that didn't care at all

And I'll drive
And I'll think about my life
And wonder why, that I'll slowly die inside
Every time I turn that truck around, right at the Georgia line and I count the days and the miles back home to you on that Highway 20 ride

So when you drive
And the years go flying by
I hope you smile
If I ever cross your mind
It was a pleasure of my life
And I cherished every time
And my whole world
It begins and ends with you
On that Highway 20 ride..."
127,lady antebellum,american honey,Country,"She grew up on a side of the road
Where the church bells ring and strong love grows
She grew up good
She grew up slow
Like American honey

Steady as a preacher
Free as a weed
Couldn't wait to get goin'
But wasn't quite ready to leave
So innocent, pure and sweet
American honey

There's a wild, wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh I miss those days as the years go by
Oh nothing's sweeter than summertime
And American honey

Get caught in the race
Of this crazy life
Tryin' to be everything can make you lose your mind
I just wanna go back in time
To American honey, yea

There's a wild, wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh I miss those days as the years go by
Oh nothing's sweeter than summertime
And American honey

Gone for so long now
I gotta get back to her somehow
To American honey

Ooh There's a wild, wild whisper
Blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh I miss those days as the years go by
Oh nothin's sweeter than summertime

That you might still be listenin'
Lovin' and forgivin' guys like me
I've spent my whole life gettin' it all wrong

I wanna be a good man
A 'do like I should' man
I wanna be the kind of man the mirror likes to see
I wanna be a strong man
And admit that I was wrong, man
God I'm asking you to come change me
To the man I wanna be

There's anyway for her and me to make another start
Could you see what you could do
To put some love back in her heart
Cuz' it going to take a miracle
After all I've done to really make her see

That I wanna be a statement
I wanna be a great man
I wanna be the kind of man that she sees in her dreams
God, I wanna be your man
And I wanna be her man
God, I only hope she still believes
In the man I wanna be

Well, I know this late at night that talk is cheap
Lord, don't give up on me

I wanna be a givin' man
I wanna really start livin' man

To the man I wanna be"
130,miranda lambert,the house that built me,Country,"I know they say you can't go home again.
I just had to come back one last time.
Ma'am I know you don't know me from Adam.
But these handprints on the front steps are mine.
And up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar.
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard.

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here it's like I'm someone else,
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave.
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me.

Mama cut out pictures of houses for years.
From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazines.
Plans were drawn, concrete poured,
And nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to mama's dream.

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here it's like I'm someone else,
I thought that maybe I could find myself.
If I could just come in I swear I'll leave.
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me.

You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can.
I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am.

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing.
Out here it's like I'm someone else,
I thought that maybe I could find myself.
If I could walk around I swear I'll leave.
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me."
131,brad paisley,water,Country,"Inflatable pool full of dad's hot air
I was three years old
Splashin' everywhere
And so began my love affair
With water

On a river bank
With all my friends
A big old rope tied to a limb
And your a big old wuss
If you don't jump in
The water

Yeah when that summer sun starts to beatin' down
And you don't know what to do
Grab your swimming trunks
Ice up that old igloo
Drive until the map turns blue

Daytona Beach on spring break
Eighteen girls up on stage
White t-shirts about to be sprayed
With water

Oh let'er go boys

Yeah when that summer sun starts to beatin' down
And you don't know what to do
Just go and grab someone you wanna see in a bathing suit
And drive until the map turns blue

You can stay right there
When the daylights gone
Play truth or dare
And it wont take long
'Fore you and her got nothin' on
But water

All you really need this time of year
Is a pair of shades
And ice cold beer
And a place to sit somewhere near
Water"
132,luke bryan,rain is a good thing,Country,"[Verse:]
My daddy spent his life lookin' up at the sky
He'd cuss, kick the dust, sayin' son it's way too dry
It clouds up in the city, the weather man complains
But where I come from, rain is a good thing

[Chorus:]
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby feel a little frisky
Back roads are boggin' up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our honeys down, we take 'em into town
Start washin' all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

[Verse 2:]
Ain't nothin' like a kiss out back in the barn
Wringin' out our soakin' clothes, ridin' out a thunderstorm
When tin roof gets to talkin'; that's the best love we made
Yea where I come from, rain is a good thing

Repeat Chorus

[Bridge:]

Creeks on the rise, roll up your pants
Country girls, they wanna cuddle
Kids out playin' in a big mud puddle

Took every ounce of heart and sweat and blood
To get to wear those game day jerseys down the hall
Kings of the school man, we're the boys of fall

It's slingin' mud and dirt and grass
It's I got your number, I got your back, when your back's against the wall
You mess with one man, you got us all,

In little towns like mine, that's all they got
Newspaper clippings fill the coffee shops,

Underneath the sycamore tree
Save all your kisses up, bring on your sweet love
Pour it all over me, all over me

We can build us a fire when we run out of daylight
Let it light up your face
Lay on a blanket, listen to the river
Get a little carried away

So pick a place on the map we can get to fast
Where the white sandy beach meets water like glass
And if the tide carries us away

Baby we'll roll with it
Won't think about it too much
Baby let's just go with it
And get out of this ordinary everyday rut

And we get swept away by one of those perfect days
When the sun is sinking low at dusk
And wind up a little deeper in love
Baby lets roll with it

We get so caught up in catching up
Trying to pay the rent trying to make a buck
That don't leave much time for time for us
And aint life too short for that

So open up that bag of pig skins you bought
At the Exxon station the last time we stopped
And you kick back baby and dance in your socks
On the windshield to some radio rock

And we'll roll with it
Won't think about it too much
Baby let's just go with it
And get out of this ordinary everyday rut

And we get swept away by one of those perfect days
When the sun is sinking low at dusk
And wind up a little deeper in love
Baby lets roll with it

And it won't be no thing if it starts to rain
And we have to wait it out in the truck
We might wind up a little deeper in love
So baby lets roll with it"

But every thought she had I heard
From across the room
We were standing face to face
I couldn't find the words to say

I don't even know her name
I guess foolish pride's to blame

Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away
And my heart won't tell my mind
To tell my mouth what it should say
I may have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Now I'm fallin in love as she's walkin away

Wise man next to me did say
About the one that got away
Son I missed my chance
Don't you let regret take place
Of the dreams you have to chase
Ask her to dance
(Go on son)

You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith

But don't be fallin in love as she's walkin away
When your heart won't tell your mind
To tell your mouth what it should say
May have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Don't be fallin in love as she's walkin away

You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith

Don't be fallin in love as she's walkin away
When your heart won't tell your mind
To tell your mouth what it should say
May have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Don't be fallin
Fallin in
Fallin in love as she's walkin away"

And I thought heaven help us if he's anything like me

He'll probably climb a tree too tall and ride his bike too fast
End up every summer wearin' something in a cast
He's gonna throw a ball and break some glass in a window down the street

He's gonna get in trouble, oh he's gonna get in fights
I'm gonna lose my temper and some sleep
It's safe to say that I'm gonna get my payback if he's anything like me

I can see him right now, knees all skinned up
With a magnifying glass tryin' to melt the Tonka truck
Won't he be a sight with his football helmet on?
That'll be his first love 'til his first love comes along

He'll get his heart broke by the time he's in his teens
And heaven help him if he's anything like me

He'll probably stay out too late and drive his car too fast
Get a speeding ticket, he'll pay for mowing grass
He's gonna get caught skippin' class and be grounded for a week

He's gonna get into trouble, we're gonna get in fights
I'm gonna lose my temper and some sleep
It's safe to say that I'm gonna get my payback if he's anything like me

He's gonna love me and hate me along the way
Years are gonna fly by and I already dread the day

He's gonna hug his momma, he's gonna shake my hand
He's gonna act like he can't wait to leave
But as he drives out he'll cry his eyes out if he's anything like me
There's worst folks to be like, oh he'll be alright if he's anything like me"

Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh oh Oh oh

Lord make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors, oh and
Life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby

The sharp knife of a short life, well
I've had just enough time

If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song

The sharp knife of a short life, well
I've had just enough time

And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

The sharp knife of a short life, well
I've had just enough time

So put on your best boys and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done

A penny for my thoughts, oh no I'll sell them for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I been singin'
Funny when you're dead how people start listenin'

If I die young bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh oh

The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save them for a time when your really gonna need them oh

The sharp knife of a short life, well
I've had just enough time

So put on your best boys and I'll wear my pearls"

From the side of a family that long ago came
Over here on a boat from somewhere in Spain
Sounded to me just a little bit strange, I guess.
But I have to admit
It felt good on my lips.

She tipped the dj to play her favorite song
A Spanish little number that was rockin' on strong
She grabbed me by the sleeve and said lets go and get it on
By the second chorus I was singing right along with it
I don't know what it meant
But it felt good on my lips.

Oh oh oh I wanna go crazy
You can go crazy too
Oh oh oh I wanna go crazy
Wanna go crazy with you
Everybody sayin' whoaaa how sweet it is
(Whoaa oooh)
Whoaaa, yeah it felt good on my lips

She ordered us a drink
It was a purple kind of pink
She said it's got a shot of a little bit of everything
Mello yellow umbrella for a fella like me
It was just a bit mello for me to be seen with
But I took a sip
Yeah it felt good on my lips

Oh oh oh I wanna go crazy
You can go crazy too
Oh oh oh I wanna go crazy
Wanna go crazy with you
Everybody sayin whoaaa how sweet it is
(Whoaa oooh)
Whoaaa oh, yeah it felt good on my lips

(Guitar solo)

When the lights came on and they hollered last call
I was busy getting lost in her cherry lip gloss
In a little corner booth I don't like no talk
She leaned in close and gave me one long and wet
A goodnight goodbye kiss
And it felt good on my lips

Whooaa oh how sweet it is

You said pick me up at three a.m.
You're fighting with your mom again

I won't sit outside your house

Call up an ex to rescue me, climb in their bed
When I'd much rather sleep somewhere with you

When the rain came down and we took cover
Down in your car, out by the pier
You laid me down, whispered in my ear

I hate my life, hold on to me
Ah, if you ever decide to leave
Then I'll go, I'll go, I'll go

I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high 'cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you, somewhere with you

If you see me out on the town
And it looks like I'm burning it down
You won't ask and I won't say
But in my heart I'm always somewhere with you

Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah
Driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on

In the offering plate on Sunday
And granddad sayin' you can have a few
But don't ever cross that line

Turns out I'm pretty dang lucky
For all that good advice
Those hard to find words of wisdom
Holed up here in my mind
And just when I've lost my way
Or I got to many choices

I hear voices
I hear voices like
My dad sayin' quit the team
And you'll be a quitter for the rest of your life
Mama tellin' me to say a prayer
Every time I lay down at night
And grandma sayin' if you find the one
You'd better treat her right

Sometimes I try to ignore 'em
But I thank God for 'em

You need to know... Where I'm standin' now
That I'm right on the edge of givin' in to ya
Baby it's a long way down

If I fall, can ya let me down easy
If I leave my heart with you tonight
Will ya promise me that you're gonna treat it right
I'm barely hangin' on
If I fall, can ya let me down easy

The scent of your perfume, floatin' in the air
You're lookin' like an angel lyin' on a blanket with a halo of hair
And those lips, look too good to be true
Once I taste that kiss, I know what'll happen... I'll be at the mercy of you

If I fall, can ya let me down easy
If I leave my heart with you tonight
Will ya promise me that you're gonna treat it right

155,thompson square,are you gonna kiss me or not,Country,"We were sittin' up there on your momma's roof
Talkin' about everything under the moon
With the smell of honeysuckle and your perfume
All I could think about was my next move

Oh, but you were so shy, so was I
Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me
""Are you gonna kiss me or not?""

Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I like you a lot
But you're about to miss your shot
""Are you gonna kiss me or not?""

It was the best dang kiss I ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later I'd have to ask for your hand

So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band and got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me
""Are you gonna kiss me or not?""

Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I love you a lot
I think we've got a real good shot
""Are you gonna kiss me or not?""

So, we planned it all out for the middle of June
From the wedding cake to the honeymoon
And your momma cried
When you walked down the aisle

When the preacher man said ""Say I do""
I did and you did too, then I lifted that veil
And saw your pretty smile and I said
""Are you gonna kiss me or not?

Are we gonna do this or what?
Look at all the love we got
It ain't never gonna stop
Are you gonna kiss me or not? ""

Yeah baby, I love you a lot
I really think we've got a shot
Are you gonna kiss me or not?"

Closes the door before the winter lets the cold in
Wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay

He said I wanna see you again but I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better, can I call you then?
She said you're a ramblin man, 
You ain't ever gonna change
You've got a gypsy soul to blame, 
And you were born for leavin'

At a truck stop diner just outside of Lincoln, 
The night as black as the coffee he was drinkin'
And in the waitress eyes he sees that same old light is shinin'
And he thinks of Colorado and the girl he left behind him

He said I wanna see you again but I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better, can I call you then?
She said you're a ramblin man, 
You ain't ever gonna change
You've got a gypsy soul to blame,

Born for leavin'

Well it's a windin' road, 
When you're in the lost and found
Your a lover, I'm a runner
And we go round and round
And I love you but I leave you, 
I don't want you but I need you
You know it's you that calls me back here babyyy

Ohhh, I wanna see you again but I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better, can I call you then?
Cause I'm a ramblin man,

I ain't ever gonna change
Got a gypsy soul to blame, 
And I was born for leavin'
Born for leavin'

When I close my eyes I see you, 
No matter where I am
I can smell your perfume through these whisperin' pines

I'm with your ghost again,

I know soon we'll be together
And I can't wait till then

And her momma laughing in my arms
There's the sound of rain on the rooftop
And the game's about to start
I don't really know how I got here
But I'm so glad that I did
And it's crazy to think that one little thing
Could have changed all of this
Maybe it didn't turn out like I planned
Maybe that's why I'm such, such a lucky man

Every stoplight I didn't make
Every chance I did or I didn't take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
All the things I knew but I didn't know
Thank God for all I missed
Cause it led me here to this

Like the girl that I loved in high school
Who said she could do better
Or the college I wanted to go to
Till I got that letter
All the fights and the tears and the heartache
I thought I'd never get through
And the moment I almost gave up
All led me here to you
I didn't understand it way back when
But sittin' here right now
It all makes perfect sense

Every stoplight I didn't make
Every chance I did or I didn't take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
All the things I knew but I didn't know
Thank god for all I missed
Cause it led me here to this

Oh I cried when my momma passed away
And now I got an angel
Looking out for me today
So nothing's a mistake

Every stoplight I didn't make
Every chance I did or I didn't take
All the nights I went too far
All the girls that broke my heart
All the doors that I had to close
Everything I knew but I didn't know
Thank God for all I missed
Cause it led me here to this

Led me here to this"

Racin' down the interstate
Spilled hot coffee down the front of my jeans

Work, work, pay the rent
Money and my time spent
Not a minute left for me to be me

I've been goin' like nothin' can wait
I've gotta get my priorities straight

I need to live a little, have some fun
Take some time, and waste it on number one
Find the girl that brings my whole world to a stop
Live a little, love a lot

Friday night, here we go
Do a little do-si-do
Kick back, have a laugh, catch my breath

Tell the band slow it down
There she is; think I found
Maybe Ms Wonderful I haven't met yet

It just hit me like a wreckin' ball
She's givin' me a wake-up call

I need to live a little, have some fun
Take some time, and waste it on number one
Find the girl that brings my whole world to a stop
Live a little, love a lot

Step back, smell a rose
Feel the sand between your toes
Unplug, unwind
Step out in the sunshine

I need to live a little, have some fun
Take some time, and waste it on number one
Find the girl that brings my whole world to a stop
Live a little

I need to live a little, have some fun
Take some time, and waste it on number one
Take the girl, get a map, and pick any ol' dot
Live a little

We need to live a little, love a lot"

Riding in the car to work,
And I try to ignore the hurt.
So I Turned on the radio,
Stupid song made me think of you.
I listened to it for a minute,
But then I changed it.
I'm getting a little bit stronger.
Just a little bit stronger.

And I'm done hoping we can work it out.
I'm done with how It feels.
Spinning my wheels,
Letting you drag my heart around.
And I'm done thinking you could ever change.
I know my heart will never be the same.
But I'm telling myself I'll be ok,
Even on my weakest day.
I get a little bit stronger.

It doesn't happen overnight.
But you turn around and a months gone by,
And you realize you haven't cried.
I'm not giving you an hour, or a second,
Or another minute longer.
I'm busy getting stronger.

And I'm done hoping we could work it out.
I'm done with how It feels.

I aint the kind to wear no ring

Even though I hate to admit it
Sometime I smoke cigarettes
Christan folks say I should quit it
I just smile and say God Bless

Cause I heard Jesus he drank wine
And I bet we'd get along just fine
He could calm the storm and heal the blind
And I bet he'd understand a heart like mine

Daddy cried when he saw my tattoo
Said he loved me anyway
My brother got the brains of the family
So I thought I'd learn to sing

Cause I heard Jesus he drank wine
And I bet we'd get along just fine
He could calm the storm and heal the blind
And I bet he'd understand a heart like mine

I'll fly away from it all one day
I'll fly away...

These are the days that I will remember
When my names called on the roll
He'll meet me with two long stemmed glasses
Make a toast to me coming home

Cause I heard Jesus he drank wine
And I bet we'd get along just fine
He could calm the storm and heal the blind
And I bet he'd understand... Understand a heart like mine

A campfire over candle light
And when it comes to love,
Her idea of a romantic night

And driving through Tennessee
A little ""Dixieland Delight"" and
""The Right Time of the Night"",
And she can't keep her off of me

And though inside you know you've gotta go
The hardest part I find
Is you're all I ever knew

Without you
What will I do
Without you

I gotta break these habit chains I put on me
And be all that I can be, try and find
What I need
Memories suspend in time
All the days when you were mine
And the chance I took to move
One I thought I'd never do

A hundred yards from the spot where me and grandpa fished
There's a piece of his old fruit stand on the side of Sawmill Road
He'd be there peelin' peaches if it was twenty years ago
And what I wouldn't give
To ride around in that old truck with him
If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce them to their grandpa
Watch 'em laugh at the way he talks
I'd find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Then tell him we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror we'd all watch 'em wave
Yeah, and losing them wouldn't be so hard to take
If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd hug all three of those girls we lost from the class of '99
And I'd find my bird dog Bo and take him huntin' one more time
I'd ask Hank why he took those pills back in '53
And Janis to sing the second verse of ""Me and Bobby McGee""
Sit on a cloud and visit for a while
It'd do me good just to see them smile

Load the truck up hit the dirt road,
Jump the barbed wire, spread the word,
Light the bonfire then call the girls
King in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack n' Jim were a few good men,
Where you learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too,
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said, she said,
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know somethin' ya'll don't know, man that talk is getting old
You better mind your business man, watch your mouth,
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talkin' man y'all ain't listenin'
Them ol' dirt roads, is what y'all missin'
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turnin' off a real life drive that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
I sit back and think about them good old days
The way we were raised in our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
And if it's broke 'round here we fix it
I can take ya'll where you need to go
Down to my hood back in them woods
We do it different round here that's right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night
So if you really want to know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in and man tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the black top ends
I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turnin' off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
Let's ride
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscing on them good times
I'm turnin' off a real life drive and that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
Let's ride"
166,chris young,tomorrow,Country,"[Verse:]

Tomorrow I'm gonna leave here
I'm gonna let you go and walk away
Like every day I said I would
And tomorrow, I'm gonna listen
To that voice of reason inside my head
Telling me that we're no good

[Chorus:]

But tonight I'm gonna give in one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine
Forget all the regrets that are bound to follow
We're like fire and gasoline
I'm no good for you
You're no good for me
We only bring each other tears and sorrow
But tonight, I'm gonna love you like there's no tomorrow

[Verse 2:]

Tomorrow I'll be stronger
I'm not gonna break down and call you up
When my heart cries out for you
And tomorrow, you won't believe it,
But when I pass your house,
I won't stop no matter how bad I want to.

[Chorus:]

[Bridge:]

Baby when we're good, You know we're great
But there's too much bad for us to think
That there's anything worth trying to save

[Chorus:]

Tomorrow, I'm gonna leave here.
I'm gonna let you go and walk away like every day I said I would"
167,zac brown band featuring jimmy buffett,knee deep,Country,"Gonna put the world away for a minute
Pretend I don't live in it
Sunshine gonna wash my blues away
Had sweet love but I lost it
Got too close so I fought it
Now I'm lost in the world tryin to find me a better way

Wishin' I was
Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky, breeze and it don't seem fair
The only worry in the world
Is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Wrote a note, said ""Be back in a minute""
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody's gonna miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishin' my condition ain't ever gonna go away

Now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowin' wind thru my hair
Only worry in the world
Is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

This champagne shore washin' over me
It's a sweet sweet life livin' by the salty sea
One day you can be as lost as me
Change your geography and maybe you might be

Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowin' wind thru my hair
Only worry in the world
Is the tide gonna reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

Come on in
The waters nice
Find yourself a little slice
Grab a backpack
Otherwise you'll never know until you try
When you lose yourself
You find a key to paradise"

And Ray had a date with his wife and Nate quit drinking but he didn't tell

Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer
Kick it to the morning light
If I have to raise hell all by myself
I will but y'all that ain't right
It's time to get it on
Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?

Well I was flying solo down at Silverado's
The joint looking like a morgue
When this country cutie with a rock & roll booty
Came strutting in through the door
Yelled, ""Who wants to dance?"" and fired up the band with with a Franklin
And a shot of patron
She looked right at me and said
""What's it gonna be are you gonna let me to party alone?""

Am I the only one who wants to have fun tonight?

Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town, and new to me
Her ruby red lips was sippin' on sweet tea
Shot me in love like a shootin' star

Horns a honkin, I've about had it
I'm lookin for an exit sign
Gotta get outta here, get it all off my mind
And like a memory from your grandpa's attic
A song comes slippin through the radio static
Changin my mood
A little George Strait 1982

And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two lane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take, makes me wanna take a back road

I've been cooped up, tied down
'Bout forgotten what a field looks like full of corn and cotton
If I'm gonna hit a traffic jam
Well it better be a tractor man
So sick and tired of this interstate system
I need the curvin, windin, twistin dusty path to nowhere
With the wind blowin through my baby's hair

Yeah it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab my honey
Tear down some two lane country
Who knows
Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take, makes me wanna take a back road
Some old back road

Maybe it's the feelin
Or maybe it's the freedom
Maybe it's that shady spot where we park the truck when things get hot
Girl we park the truck when things get hot

And it makes me wanna take a back road
Makes me wanna take the long way home
Put a little gravel in my travel
Unwind, unravel all night long
Makes me wanna grab your honey
Tear down some two lane country

Get lost and get right with my soul
Makes me wanna take, makes me wanna take a back road

To the shady spot where things get hot girl

Ain't no sleep a'coming
I'm just lying here thinking 'bout you
I'm in deep
Falling deep into the picture in my mind of everything we're gonna do

Over at the lake and down by the river
You can feel it start to rise
Wanna jump in my car, go wherever you are
'Cause I need you by my side

It's gonna be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, it's such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day, I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind, just waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go down

I wanna see your brown skin shimmer in the sun for the first time
I try to be the one who knows just what to do to you to get me that smile
One chance of meeting, you were walking by me on the street and I said hi
And that was the beginning of my heart spinnin' like these wheels in my head tonight

It's gonna be a long, hot summer, we should be together
With your feet up on the dashboard now
Singing along with the radio, it's such a beautiful sound
And when you say my name in the middle of the day, I swear I see the stars come out
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind, just waiting on the sun to go down, the sun to go down

The only place that I wanna be is where you are
'Cause anymore than a heartbeat away is just too far

It's gonna be a long, hot summer, we should be together
All I really want is more than this moment right now
And when you say my name in the middle of the day, I swear I see the stars come out
And when you hold my hand and I look into your eyes
I swear it looks like you're waiting for the sun to go down, the sun to go down

I swear it's like you're waiting for the sun to go down
Waiting on the sun to go down

I've been a walking heartache
I've made a mess of me
The person that I've been lately
Ain't who I wanna be

But you stay here right beside me
Watch as the storm goes through
And I need you

[Chorus]
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
For when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you

[Blake Shelton - Verse 2]
There's more here than what were seeing
A divine conspiracy
That you, an angel lovely
Could somehow fall for me
You'll always be love's great martyr
I'll be the flattered fool
And I need you

[Chorus]
God gave me you for the ups and downs
God gave me you for the days of doubt
For when I think I've lost my way
There are no words here left to say, it's true
God gave me you

On my own I'm only
Half of what I could be
I can't do without you
We are stitched together
And what love has tethered
I pray we never undo

God gave me you for the days of doubt
God gave me you for the ups and downs

Kinda know that I won't get far

Close enough to touch
Close enough so hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be

I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you, I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but
I really wish you would

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby

Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

I'll run my fingers through your hair
And watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And meet me up the staircase
Won't you whisper something slow
I'm captivated by you, baby
Like a firework show

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

From Ohio; thought ""Oh, good Lord, he's lost""

From his Wranglers to his boots
He reminded me of Chris Ledoux
And that Copenhagen smile
Yeah, country must be country wide

Playin' Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four-wheel drives
There's cowbys and hillbilles
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
Country must be country wide

It ain't where, it's how you live
We weren't raised to take, we were raised to give
The shirt off our back to anyone in need

We bow our heads before we eat
Before we start our day, before we fall asleep
'Cause in God we trust, and we believe

And we see what's wrong
And we know what's right

When he sang ""Country Folks Can Survive""

She was the purest beauty
But not the common kind
She had a way about her
That made you feel alive
And for a moment
You made the world stand still

Yeah we owned the night

You had me dim the lights; 
You danced just like a child
The wine spilled on your dress
And all you did was smile
Yeah, it was perfect
I hold it in my mind

Yeah, we owned the night

When the summer rolls around
And the sun starts sinking down
I still remember you
Oh, I remember you
And I wonder where you are
Are you looking at those same stars again?
Do you remember when?
We woke under a blanket
All tangled up in skin
Not knowing in that moment
We'd never speak again
But it was perfect;

To let it run through my hands.
Run through my hands.

Well, I don't want the whole world,
The sun, the moon and all their light.
I just wanna be the only girl,
You love all your life
You love all your life

Would you catch a couple thousand fireflies?
Put them in a lamp to light my world.
All dressed up in a tux and bowtie.
Hand delivered to a lonely girl.

Well, I don't want the whole world
The sun, the moon, and all their light
I just wanna be the only girl
You love all your life
You love all your life

Lately I've been writing desperate love songs.
Mostly sing them to the wall.
You could be the center piece of my obsession
If you would notice me...
Yeah, yeah.

Well, I don't want the whole world, no
The sun, the moon, and all their light
I just wanna be the only girl
You love all your life
You love all your life

You love all your life, life, yeah."

Just like that you gotta brand new life

We could go up north we could head down south
Roll down the windows with the radio loud
Come on turn it up yeah
Start living your life
On the double leave your troubles behind
You and me we gonna be alright
[Chorus:]
You could be a black bird on a country street
Hiding from the world with a broken wing
But you better believe you gonna fly with me
And you could be a songbird from New Orleans
Scared of the rain just a scared to sing
But you better believe you gonna fly with me
Well here we are baby in the back of my bed
Sun's going down sky's turning red
Stars coming out baby look at you now
God knows how long but it's been awhile
Since I heard you laugh and I seen that smile
Felt that kiss and I could get used to this
Baby I could get used to this
[Chorus:]
You gonna fly
But you gonna fly
[Chorus:]
You could be a black bird on a country street
Hiding from the world with a broken wing
But you better believe you gonna fly with me

187,kenny chesney,reality,Country,"For me, it's a beach bar
Or on a boat underneath the stars
Or with my band up on a stage
For awhile, everything's okay

For some, it's a fast car
Moonshine in a mason jar
But everybody has their way
Somehow to escape

Reality
Yeah, sometimes, life ain't all it is cracked up to be
So, let's take a chance, and live this fantasy
'Cause everbody needs to break free
From reality

Oh, yeah

Guess somedays, it's a bitch; it's a bummer
We need a rock 'n' roll show in the summer
We'll let the music take us away
Take our minds to a better place

Where we feel that sense of freedom
Leave our worries behind us; we don't need 'em
All we need is a sunny day, and an ol' tailgate
And we'll escape

Reality
Yeah, sometimes, life ain't all it is cracked up to be
So, let's take a chance, and live this fantasy
'Cause everbody needs to break free
From reality

Everybody, raise your hands and voice tonight
Set your soul free; let's take a carpet ride
We'll leave it all behind

Oh, yeah

Reality
Yeah, sometimes, life ain't all it is cracked up to be

From reality
Yeah, oh, yeah

C'mon, everybody, break free
C'mon everybody, break free"
188,dierks bentley,home,Country,"West, on a plane bound west
I see stretching out below
Land, blessed mother land
The place where I was born

Scars, she's got her scars
Sometimes it starts to worry me
Lose, I don't want to lose
Sight of who we are

From the mountains high
To the wave crash coast
There's a way to find
Better days I know

It's been a long hard ride
Got a ways to go
This is still the place
That we all call home

Free, nothing feels like free
But it sometimes means we don't get along
Same, no were not the same
But that's what makes us strong

From the mountains high
To the wave crash coast
There's a way to find
Better days I know

It's been a long hard ride
Got a ways to go
This is still the place
That we all call home

Brave, gotta call it brave
To chase that dream across the sea
Names, and they signed their names
For something they believed

Red, how the blood ran red
And we laid our dead in the sacred ground
Just think, wonder what they think
If they could see us now

It's been a long hard ride
Got a ways to go
This is still the place
That we all call home

It's been a long hard ride
And I won't lose hope
This is still the place
That we all call home"
189,taylor swift,ours,Country,"Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs

Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high
The waters rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, cause right now you're mine

And you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high
The waters rough
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate
If it's wrong and your hands are tough but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you

Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
Cause my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high
The waters rough
But this love is ours"

Last night out of the blue
Driftin' off to the evenin' news
She said ""Honey, what would you do
""If you'd have never met me""

I just laughed, said ""I don't know,
""But I could take a couple guesses though""
And then tried to dig real deep,
Said, ""Darlin', honestly

""I'd do a lot more offshore fishin'
""Probably eat more drive-thru chicken
""Take a few strokes off my golf game
""If I'd a never known your name
""I'd still be drivin' that old green 'Nova
""I probably never would have heard of yoga
""Be a better football fan
""But if I was a single man
""Alone and out there on the loose
""I'd be lookin' for a woman like you""

Well, I could tell that got her attention
So I said, ""Oh yeah, I forgot to mention
""I wouldn't trade a single day
""For a hundred years the other way""
She just smiled and rolled her eyes
'Cause she's heard all of my lines
I said, ""C'mon on girl, seriously
""If I hadn't been so lucky

""I'd be shootin' pool in my bachelor pad
""Playin' bass in my cover band
""Restockin' up cold Bud Light
""For poker every Tuesday night, yeah
""I'd have a dirtbike in the she'd
""And not one throw pillow on the bed
""I'd keep cash in a coffee can
""But if I was a single man
""Alone and out there on the loose
""I'd be looking for a woman like you""

She knows what a mess I'd be if I didn't have her here
But to be sure, I whispered in her ear

""You know I get sick deep-sea fishin'
""And you make the best fried chicken
""I got a hopeless golf game
""I love the sound of your name
""I might miss that old green 'Nova
""But I love watchin' you do yoga
""I'd take a gold band on my hand

Come back and sit back down.
You look to good to be headin home so early now,
You say you gotta work tomorrow, got a lot on your mind.
Let my buy another round,
Girl I think you and I should just drink on it

Put are heads together and think on it.
Maybe later on we can sleep on it,
But for right now, girl we just need to drink on it.

We can talk rocket science, Jesus or politics.
How your boyfriend cheated on you,
Man he sounds like such a prick.
I can use another wiskey,
And your cosmos getting low.
While were tryin to figure out the next place we should go,
We can drink on it.

Put are heads together and think on it.
Maybe later on we can sleep on it,
But for right now, girl we just need to drink on it.

This place is closin now, but I don't wanna quit.
Got a good thing going girl, lets find out what it is
And drink on it.

Your place or mine, we can drink on it.
Dust off a bottle and drink on it.
Feels like we're doin something right lets find the corner of a night where
You and I can just drink on it.

Put are heads together and think on it.
Maybe later on we can sleep on it,
But for right now, girl we just need to drink on it.
Might make a memory that we wont forgot,
So lets just drink on it.

Mhmmm, drink on it"

Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out
Crickets and frogs

And you kick it into four wheel drive when you run out of road and you go, and you go and you go-go-go
'Til you hear banjo

It ain't on the map
And I'm glad it isn't
Leave the phone and the gps, those satellites ain't found it yet,
Got our own little piece of heaven hidden"

From new York to Los Angeles, 
Kinda making small talk killing time, 
Flirting with the flight attendants, 
30, 000 feet above, could be Oklahoma, 
Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms, 
Man it all looks the same, 
Miles and miles of back roads and highways, 
Connecting little towns with funny names, 
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere, 

They've never drove through Indiana, 
Met the man who plowed that earth, 
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me, 
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas, 
They'd understand why god made those fly over states, 

I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul
Road and rails under their feet
Yeah that sounds like a first class seat

On the plains of Oklahoma 
With a windshield sunset in your eyes
Like a watercolor painted sky
Where like a water color painted sky

You'd think heavens doors have opened
You'll understand why god made 
Those fly over states

Take a ride across the badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
Meet a girl from Amarillo
You'll understand why god made 
You might even wanna plant your stakes
In those fly over states, yeah

Have you ever been through Indiana
On the plains of Oklahoma
Take a ride"

A no trespass sign, and time to kill
Nobody's gonna get hurt, so what's the big deal
Something about a truck in a farmer's field

Something about beer sitting on ice
After a long hard day makes it taste just right
On that dropped tailgate on a summer night
Something about beer sitting on ice

Something about a girl in a red sundress
With an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
In that farmer's field, will make a boy a mess
Something about a girl in a red sundress

Something about a kiss that's gonna lead to more
On that dropped tailgate, back behind the corn
The most natural thing, you've ever felt before
Something about a kiss that's gonna lead to more

Something about a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
Something about you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothing about it luck, something about a truck

Something about a creek around 2 am
After a few of those beers you wanna dive on in
You don't need no clothes, just hang em on a limb
Something about a creek around 2 am

Something about a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
Something about you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothing about it luck, something about a truck
Ain't nothing about it luck, something about a truck"

I see you standin' there all night long
Discount shades, store-bought tan, flip flops and cut off jeans
Somewhere between that set and the sun
I'm on fire, I'm born to run
You looked at me and I was done
Well, with just gettin' started
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter, we sang oh woah woah
Stayed there till' they forced us out,
Took the long way to your house,
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' don't go.

When I think about you, I think about seventeen
I think about my old jeep, I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how the melody sounds like a memory,
Like a soundtrack to a july saturday night.
Springsteen.

I bumped into you by happenstance,
Probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name I bet, still be a spark.
Back when I was gasoline, and this old tattoo had brand new ink,
And we didn't care what your momma thinks about your name on my arm.
Baby is it spring or is it summer,
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night on your radio.
Even though you're a million miles away,
When you hear Born In The usa,
You relive those glory days so long ago.

When you think about me, do you think about seventeen
Do you think about my old jeep, think about the stars in the sky
Funny how the melody sounds like a memory,
Like a soundtrack to a july saturday night.
Springsteen.

Throwing little cherry bombs into my fire

Oh I can hear 'em singing

Old enough to get there but too young to get inside
So I would stand out on the sidewalk
Listen to the music playin every Friday night

Drag you around and bring you back to where you were
Some dreams keep on getting better
Gotta keep believing if you wanna know for sure

Get yourself a koozie
Let's go

Who said anything about skiin'?
Floatin' is all I wanna do
You can climb the ladder
Just don't rock the boat while I barbecue

Chorus:
On the pontoon
Makin' waves and catchin' rays up on the roof
Jumpin' off the back, don't act like you don't want to
Party in slow motion
Out here in the open
Mmmmm... Motorboatin'

(Who who who)

Reach your hand down into the cooler
Don't drink it if the mountains aren't blue
Try to keep it steady as you recline on your black intertube

Chorus:
Pontoon
Makin' waves and catchin' rays up on the roof
Jumpin' off the back, don't act like you don't want to
Party in slow motion
Out here in the open
Mmmmmm... Motorboatin'

(Who who who)
(Who who who)

Bridge:
5 mile an hour with aluminum sides
Wood panelin' with a water slide
Can't beat the heat, so let's take a ride

Chorus:
On the pontoon
Makin' waves and catchin' rays up on the roof
Jumpin' off the back, don't act like you don't want to
Party in slow motion
I'm out here in the open
Mmmm... Motorboatin'

On the pontoon

(Who who who)

On the pontoon

(Who who who)

Back this hitch out into the water
On the pontoon

(Who who who)

207,hunter hayes,wanted,Country,"You gave me chances and I let you down
You waited for words that I couldn't get out
I have no excuses for the way that I am
I was clueless then, I couldn't understand

All that you wanted, and all that you needed
Was a side of me I never let you see

I wish I could love you and make you believe it
Cuz that's all you ever wanted
That's all you ever wanted, from me

An oooohhh

Could I be selfish, or lost in my pride
Afraid to be forward, or just to scared to try
And Now I'm without you, and it took distance to see
That losing you, means losing everything

All that you wanted, and all that you needed
Was a side of me I never let you see

And I wish I could love you and make you believe it
Cuz that's all you ever wanted
That's all you ever wanted, from me

And is it too late, and are you too far
To turn around and let me be

Let me be

All that you wanted, and all that you needed
I'll show a side of me I never let you see

I wish I could love you and make you believe it
Cuz that's all you ever wanted
Yeah That's all you ever wanted,
And that's all you ever wanted
That's all you ever wanted,

From me... Oh, from me"

Bailin' some hay and stacking it all up
Can't wait for the Sun to go down

Roll into town
Shine the old truck up
Swing by the quick stop
Grab a couple rocky tops
Then ease on out your way
To your place around 8 o'clock

Well I'm just ready to ride this chevy,
Ride this chevy down a little backroad
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean your seat back
Man I swear there ain't nothing looks better than that
Sweet tan, little thing with nothing to do
I wanna take a little ride with you

I hope you're wearing those frayed out cut-offs
Makes me want to get lost down in the moonlight
Drop the tailgate down on a turn road
Watch the corn grow, baby that's a good night
Anyone from the heartland is gonna understand
What I'm talking about right now
Ain't no doubt, we got a gameplan

Well I'm just ready to ride this chevy,
Ride this chevy down a little backroad
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio

Saying this is it, I've had enough, 'cause like
We haven't seen each other in a month
When you, said you, needed space, what?
Then you come around again and say
Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change
Trust me, remember how that lasted for a day
I say, I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you

Oooh we called it off again last night
But Oooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk
To my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Like ever... 

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you, will hide away and find your piece of mind, with some indie record
That's much cooler than mine

Oooh you called me up again tonight
But oooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk
To my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

I used to think, that we, were forever ever
And I used to say never say never

Huh, he calls me up and he's like, I still love you
And I'm like, I'm just, I mean this is exhausting, you know like
We are never getting back together, like ever

No!

210,florida georgia line,cruise,Country,"Intro:
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Hey baby

Verse 1:
Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s popping right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good lord, she had them long tanned legs""
Could not help myself so I walked up and said

Chorus:
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you
In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit
Would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it
So baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

Verse 2:
She was sipping on Southern and singing Marshall Tucker
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
""Fire it up, let us go get this thing stuck""

Chorus

Verse 3:
When that summer sun fell to its knees
I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those kc lights and drove all night
Because it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right

Verse 4:
I put it in park and
Grabbed my guitar
And strummed a couple chords
And sang from the heart
Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumping
Hell I cannot get you out of my head

Interlude:
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road blowing stop signs through the middle
Every little farm town with you

Chorus:

Outro:
Baby you a song
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Come on girl
Get those windows down and cruise

211,the band perry,better dig two,Country,"I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you till I’s dead
Made you wait till our weddin’ night
That’s the first and the last time I’ll wear white
*Huff*
So if the ties that bind ever do come loose
Tie ‘em in a knot like a hangman’s noose.
‘Cause I’ll go to heaven or I’ll go to hell
Before I see you with someone else

Chorus
Put me in the ground
And put me six foot down
And let the stone say
Here lies the girl whose only crutch was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do,
I’m gonna tell the grave digger that he better dig two!

Well it won’t be whiskey
It won’t be meth
It will be your name on my last breath
If the voice of death ever do us part
The coroner will call it a broken heart

Chorus
So put me in the ground
Put me six foot down
And let the stone say
Here lies the girl whose only crutch was loving one man a little too much
If you go before I do
I’m gonna tell the grave digger that he better dig two
Dig two

I took your name when I took those vows
I meant ‘em back then and I mean ‘em right now
Oh right now

If the ties that bind ever do come loose
If forever ever ends for you
If that ring gets a little too tight
Might as well read me my last rights

And let the stone say
Here lies the girl whose only crutch was loving one man just a little too much
If you go before I do
Gonna tell the grave digger that he better dig
Hey!
There'll be a stone right next to mine
We’ll be together till the end of time
Don’t you go before I do
Gonna tell the grave digger that he better dig two

I told you on the day we wed
I was gonna love you till I’s dead."
213,blake shelton,sure be cool if you did,Country,"I was gonna keep it real like chill like only have a drink or two
But it turned into a party when I started talking to you
Now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on
Baby it's your call, no pressure at all

You don’t have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter and lean a little closer
You don’t have to keep on smiling that smile that’s driving me wild and when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat and do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don’t have to keep me fallin’ like this
But it’d sure be cool if you did

You can’t shoot me down cause you've already knocked me dead
Got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head
Let your mind take a little back road
Just as far as you wanna go
Baby I’ll do whatever you wanna do
Wanna do

You don’t have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter and lean a little closer
You don’t have to keep on smiling that smile that’s driving me wild and when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat and do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don’t have to keep me fallin’ like this
But it’d sure be cool if you did

Have a night that you'll never forget
And now you're standing in the neon
Looking like a high I wanna be on

You don’t have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter and lean a little closer
You don’t have to keep on smiling that smile that’s driving me wild and when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat and do a little bit of country song, hanging on

214,darius rucker,wagon wheel,Country,"Heading down south to the land of the pines
I’m thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I’m a-hopin’ for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey momma rock me
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey momma rock me

Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
I lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain’t turning back to living that old life no more

So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey momma rock me
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey momma rock me

Walkin’ to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he’s a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I gotta get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she’s the only one
And if I died in Raleigh at least I will die free

So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey momma rock me
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey momma rock me"

You got that sun tan skirt and boots
Waiting on you to look my way and scoot
Your little hot self over here
Girl hand me another beer, yeah!

All them other boys wanna wind you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin’ down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Gonna sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!

Might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate
Put in my country rock hip-hop mixtape
Little Conway, a little T-Pain, might just make it rain

You can hang your t-shirt on a limb
Hit that bank and we can ease on in
Soak us up a little moonlight
You know I know what you like, yeah!

All them other boys wanna wind you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin’ down the Flint River, catch us up a little catfish dinner
Gonna sound like a winner, when I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!
Yeah, that’s my kind of night!

My kind of your kind of its this kind of night
We dance in the dark and your lips land on mine
Gonna get our love on
Time to get our buzz on

And I'd break my bones just to heal your pain
And in these times I need a saving grace
'Cause time is running out and I'm starting to lose my faith

[Chorus:]
But if I told you I loved you would it make you wanna stay
I'm sorry for the way I hurt you and makin' you walk away, (I shoulda took the time to tell you)
And if I wrote you a love song and sang it to you everyday
Would it ever be enough to make you wanna come back home and stay, (I can't go another day without you)
Would it make you, make you wanna stay/(Girl you gotta know I love you)

My heart's on my sleeve but it's turning black
(I guess I know what it feels like to be alone)
Without your touch, I'm not gonna last
(I know you know that I need you just to carry on)
It feels like my walls are caving in
(You always wanted it more, I left you hangin' on)
And I'll do anything to have you here again

But if I told you I loved you would it make you wanna stay
I'm sorry for the way I hurt you and makin' you walk away, (I shoulda took the time to tell you)

Would it ever be enough to make you wanna come back home and stay, (I can't go another day without you)

Yeah the days are cold, the nights are long
And I can't stand to be alone
Please know this is not your fault/And all I want is

To tell you I love you and make you wanna stay
There's gotta be a way 'cause goin' on without you is killing me everyday

And if I wrote you a love song and sang it to you everyday
Would it ever be enough to make you come back home and stay

I didn't know what to say.
So I just hung up the phone.
I took a walk to clear my head,
This is where the walking lead
Can't believe you're really gone
Don't feel like going home

So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

Funny how the good ones go
Too soon, but the good lord knows
The reasons why it gets
Sometimes the greater plan is kinda hard to understand
Right now it don't make sense
I can't make it all make sense

So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

So long my friend, until we meet again
I'll remember you
And all the times we used to
Sit right here on the edge of this pier
Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer
Drink a beer, drink a beer."

Thinkin', no way she ain't got one
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

She was like, oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is
She was like, come here boy, I wanna dance
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out

And she said, play it again, play it again, play it again
And I said, play it again, play it again, play it again

I'd have gave that dj my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool am, fm, xm too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

She was like, oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe it came back on, but here it is
She was like, come here boy, I wanna dance
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, play it again, play it again, play it again
And she said, play it again, play it again, play it again

The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

Makes you wanna build
A 10 percent down
White picket fence house on this dirt


You know you came from it
Dirt

And some day you'll return to
This elm shade red rust clay
You grew up on
That plowed up ground
That your dad
Damned his luck on
That post game party field
You circle up on
And when it rains
You get stuck on
Drift a cloud back
Behind county roads
That you run up
And mud on her jeans
That she peeled off
And hung up
Her blue eyed
Summer time smile
Looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build
A 10 percent down
White picket fence house on this dirt

Makes you wanna build
A 10 percent down
White picket fence house on this dirt

You know you came from it
And some day you'll return to it"
226,jason aldean,burnin' it down,Country,"You slip your finger through the tear in my t-shirt
You stirrin' up dirty in the back of my mind
You keep on flirtin'
Cause you know that it's workin'
You stuck in my head girl writing the lines
Couldn't sing this song without you if I tried
Let's light it up like it's our last night

We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down
Burnin' it down

Girl when you want it
You know that I'm on it
You know that I love lovin' up on you
Let's hit the switch and let our shadows dance
And light it up like it's our last chance

We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down
Burnin' it down

I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me?
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me
I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me?
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me

We're just hanging around
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
Laying right here naked in my bed
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Say it makes you feel like an angel
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Burnin' it down
Burnin' it down

I wanna rock it all night
Baby girl will you rock it out with me?
I wanna crawl through the dark
Just to feel your heartbeat against me"
227,sam hunt,leave the night on,Country,"[Verse 1]
They roll the sidewalks in this town
All up after the sun goes down
They say nothin' good happens here
When midnight rolls around
But layin' down would be in vain
I can't sleep with you on my brain
I ain't anywhere close to tired
Your kiss has got me wired

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your lovin's got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again

[Chorus]
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

[Verse 2]
Now all the stars are turnin' blue
Just kissed the clock 2: 22
Baby, I know what you're wishin' for
I'm wishin' for it too
Now all the lights are flashin' gold
Nobody cares how fast we go
Our soundtrack's in the stereo
This dj's on a roll

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your lovin's got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again

[Chorus]
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

[Bridge]
The sun'll steal the magic from us soon
So let's take one more trip around the moon

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your lovin's got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally-- 

[Chorus]
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on"
228,carrie underwood,something in the water,Country,"He said I've been where you've been before
Down every hallway's a slamming door
No way out, no one to come and save me
Wasting a life that the Good Lord gave you
There's somebody saying what I'm saying to you
Open my eyes and told me truth
He said: just a little faith and it'll all get better
So I followed that preacher man down to the river and now I'm changed
And now I'm stronger

There must've been something in the water
Oh there must've been something in the water

Well I heard what he said and I went on my way
Didn't think about it for a couple of days
Then it hit me like a lightning late one night
I was all out of hoping, all out of fight
Couldn't fight back the tears so I fell on my knees
Saying God if you're there come and rescue me
Felt love pouring down from above
Got washed in the water, washed in the blood and now I'm changed

And now I'm stronger

There must be something in the water
Oh there must be something in the water

And now I'm singing all along to amazing grace
Can't nobody wipe this smile off my face
Got joy in my heart, angels on my side
Thank God almighty I saw the light
Going to look ahead, no turning back
live everyday, give it all that I have
Trusted someone bigger than me
Ever since the day that I believed I am changed

And now I'm stronger

There must be been something in the water
Oh there must be something in the water
Oh there must be something in the water
Oh there must be something in the water
Oh yeah

I'm stronger
Stronger

I'm free"
229,tim mcgraw,shotgun rider,Country,"[Verse:]
Roll, won't you come roll with me 
Slow, fast, full speed
Girl wherever sweet time takes us
Hang, with me down this old road
Only god knows where we'll go
Don't matter long as I've got your love

[Chorus:]
I don't ever want to wake up, 
Lookin' into someone else's eyes
Another Voice calling me baby
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her makeup
Before dinner on Friday night
No I don't ever wanna know, 
No other shotgun rider, beside me, 
Singin' to the radio

[Verse 2:]
Slide, slide over nice and close
Lay your head down on my shoulder
You can fall asleep I'll let you
Dream, life aint nothing but a dream, don't wanna be 
Cruisin' through this dream without you

[Chorus:]
I don't ever want to wake up, 
Lookin' into someone else's eyes
Another Voice calling me baby
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her makeup
Before dinner on Friday night
No I don't ever wanna know
No other shotgun rider, beside me, 
Singin' to the radio

No other shotgun rider

[Chorus:] 
I don't ever want to wake up, 
Lookin' into someone else's eyes
Another Voice calling me baby
On the other end of the phone
A new girl puttin' on her makeup
Before dinner on Friday night
No I don't ever wanna know
No other shotgun rider, beside me, 
Singin' to the radio

No other shotgun rider

Singin' to the radio

You're my shotgun rider."
